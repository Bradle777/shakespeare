    <depiction role="object" gender="female">My mistress’</depiction> eyes are nothing like the sun;<l/><br/><br/>
    Coral is far more <color is="red" context="appearance">red than her lips’ red;</color><l/><br/><br/>
    If snow be <color is="white" context="pure">white</color>, why then <depiction role="impure" gender="female">her breasts are dun</depiction>;<l/><br/><br/>
    If hairs be wires, <color is="black" context="appearance">black</color> wires grow on her head.<l/><br/><br/>
    I have seen roses damasked, <color is="red" context="rose">red</color> and <color is="white" context="rose">white</color>,<l/><br/><br/>
    But <depiction role="immpure" gender="female">no such roses see I in her cheeks;</depiction><l/><br/><br/>
    And in some perfumes is there more delight<l/><br/><br/>
    Than in the <violence type="insult" gender="female">breath that from my mistress reeks</violence>.<l/><br/><br/>
    <love action="verbal">I love to hear her speak</love>, yet well I know<l/><br/><br/>
    That <violence type="insult" gender="female">music hath a far more pleasing sound.</violence><l/><br/><br/>
    I grant I never saw a <power gender="female">goddess</power> go;<l/><br/><br/>
    <depiction role="object" gender="female">My mistress</depiction>, when she walks, treads on the ground.<l/><br/><br/>
    And yet, by heaven, <love action="verbal">I think my love as rare<l/><br/><br/>
        <depiction role="respect">As any she belied with false compare.</depiction></love><l/><br/><br/>

<!-- The whole sonnet he seems to insult her and define her as different and almost less than, yet the final line 
shows that despite all that she is still beautiful-->
