            <h3>Introduction to the Project</h3>
            <p>Our project is reviewing several of Shakespeares works looking for trends in
                depictions of minoirty groups. Women for example, and finding attributes and
                descriptions of their role as wives, mothers, or in relation to a patriarchy. The
                depiction of black people is also of note throughout as we look for depictions of
                impurity assoicated with skin color.</p>

            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What kind of descriptors are used to represent marginalized communties (women
                    and racial minorities)?</li>
                <li>Are there words that reappear in terms of describing women or racial identities?
                    (seeming, more, pitch, etc.) How is purity determined?</li>
                <li>What stereotypes are being perpetrated, implicitly or explicitly?</li>
            </ul>
