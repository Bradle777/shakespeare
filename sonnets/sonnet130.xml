<l/>My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;
<l/>Coral is far more red than her lips’ red;
<l/>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
<l/>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
<l/>I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
<l/>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
<l/>And in some perfumes is there more delight
<l/>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
<l/>I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
<l/>That music hath a far more pleasing sound.
<l/>I grant I never saw a goddess go;
<l/>My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
<l/>And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
<l/>As any she belied with false compare.
