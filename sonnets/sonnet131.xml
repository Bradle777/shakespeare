<l/>Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
<l/>As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
<l/>For well thou know’st to my dear doting heart
<l/>Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
<l/>Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
<l/>Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
<l/>To say they err I dare not be so bold,
<l/>Although I swear it to myself alone.
<l/>And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
<l/>A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
<l/>One on another’s neck do witness bear
<l/>Thy black is fairest in my judgment’s place.
<l/>In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
<l/>And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
