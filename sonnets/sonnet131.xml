    <number-title>Sonnet CXXXI</number-title>
<author>Shakespeare</author>
<body>
<depiction role="villain">Thou art as tyrannous</depiction>, so as thou art,
As those whose <depiction role="villain">beauties proudly make them cruel</depiction>;
<tone vibe="romantic">For well thou know’st to <love action="verbal">my dear doting heart
Thou art the <depiction role="beauty">fairest and most precious jewel.</depiction></love>
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
<violence type="insult">Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;</violence>
<depiction role="weakness">To say they err I dare not be so bold,
Although I swear it to myself alone.</depiction>
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
One on another’s neck do witness bear
<love action="verbal">Thy <color is="black" context="pure">black</color> is fairest in my judgment’s place.</love>
In nothing art thou <color is="black" context="impure">black</color> <depiction role="villain">save in thy deeds,</depiction>
And thence <violence type="insult">this slander as I think proceeds.</violence></tone>

<!--He seems to be reffering to the lady of the previous Sonnet 130, but no gender is mentioned, gay? 
He is very clearly in love with this person, but does so privately, shown by his weakness to not speak aloud-->
