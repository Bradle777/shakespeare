        <love action="love">Thine eyes I love,</love> and they, as pitying me, <l/><br/><br/>
        <tone vibe="sad">Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain, <l/><br/><br/>Have put on <color
                is="black" context="grief">black</color>, and loving mourners be,<l/><br/><br/>
            <depiction role="villain">Looking with pretty ruth upon my
            pain.</depiction><l/><br/><br/> And truly not the morning sun of heaven <l/><br/><br/>
            Better becomes the <color is="gray" context="appearance">gray</color> cheeks of the
            east, <l/><br/><br/> Nor that full star that ushers in the even <l/><br/><br/> Doth half
            that glory to the sober west <l/><br/><br/> As those two mourning eyes become thy face.
            <l/><br/><br/> O, let it then as well beseem thy heart <l/><br/><br/> To mourn for me,
            since mourning doth thee grace, <l/><br/><br/> And suit thy pity like in every
            part.</tone>
        <l/><br/><br/> Then will I swear beauty herself is <color is="black" context="race"
            >black</color>,<l/><br/><br/> And all <depiction role="impure">they foul that thy
            complexion lack.<l/><br/><br/>
        </depiction></body>
