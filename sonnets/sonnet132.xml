<body>
<l/><love action="love">Thine eyes I love,</love> and they, as pitying me,
<l/><tone vibe="sad">Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
<l/>Have put on <color is="black" context="grief">black</color>, and loving mourners be,
<l/><depiction role="villain">Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.</depiction>
<l/>And truly not the morning sun of heaven
<l/>Better becomes the <color is="gray" context="appearance">gray</color> cheeks of the east,
<l/>Nor that full star that ushers in the even
<l/>Doth half that glory to the sober west
<l/>As those two mourning eyes become thy face.
<l/>O, let it then as well beseem thy heart
<l/>To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,
<l/>And suit thy pity like in every part.</tone>
<l/>Then will I swear beauty herself is <color is="black" context="race">black</color>,
<l/>And all <depiction role="impure">they foul that thy complexion lack.
