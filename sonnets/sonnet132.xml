<body>
<l/>Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
<l/>Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
<l/>Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
<l/>Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
<l/>And truly not the morning sun of heaven
<l/>Better becomes the gray cheeks of the east,
<l/>Nor that full star that ushers in the even
<l/>Doth half that glory to the sober west
<l/>As those two mourning eyes become thy face.
<l/>O, let it then as well beseem thy heart
<l/>To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,
<l/>And suit thy pity like in every part.
<l/>Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
<l/>And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
