<number-title>Sonnet 132</number-title>
<author>Shakespeare</author>
<body>
<love action="love">Thine eyes I love,</love> and they, as pitying me,
<tone vibe="sad">Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
Have put on <color is="black" context="grief">black</color>, and loving mourners be,
<depiction role="villain">Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.</depiction>
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the <color is="gray" context="appearance">gray</color> cheeks of the east,
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face.
O, let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,
And suit thy pity like in every part.</tone>
Then will I swear beauty herself is <color is="black" context="race">black</color>,
And all <depiction role="impure">they foul that thy complexion lack.
</depiction></body>
