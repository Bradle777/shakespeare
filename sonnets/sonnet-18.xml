    <number-title>XVIII</number-title>
Shall <chara name="speaker" gender="male">I</chara> compare <chara name="subject" gender="female">thee</chara> to a summer’s day?
<chara name="subject" gender="female">Thou</chara> art <depiction>more lovely</depiction> and <depiction>more temperate</depiction>:
    <!--add a more neutral depiction, for something like beauty, compliment, lover, etc.-->
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is <chara name="sun" gender="male">his</chara> <depiction>gold complexion dimm’d</depiction>,
And every <color is="white" context="purity">fair</color> from <color is="white" context="purity">fair</color> <depiction>sometime declines</depiction>,
    <!--add an attribute for "fair" that is simply beauty-->
By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimm’d:
But <chara name="subject" gender="female">thy</chara> eternal summer <depiction>shall not fade</depiction>,
<tone vibe="romantic">Nor lose possession of that <color is ="white" context="purity">fair</color> 
    <chara name="subject" gender="female">thou</chara> ow’st,</tone>
    <!--not sure what to do with some of these. it's important but doesn't fit all of our words. 
        Almost seems like we should make a new schema for the poems. But on the other hand, if we are just able to make them
        fit instead, I think the poems could be a great example case for the work of the rest of the project
        (especially for presentation purposes).-->
Nor shall <chara name="death" gender="male">death</chara> brag <chara name="subject" gender="female">thou</chara> 
    wander’st in <chara name="death" gender="male">his</chara> <color is="dark" context="death">shade</color>,
    <!--Color tag for basic darkness (thematic sense). When it represents just darkness, negative vibes.-->
When in eternal lines to time <chara name="subject" gender="female">thou</chara> grow’st,
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to <chara name="subject" gender="female">thee</chara>.<power></power>
    <!-- I feel like this is an important aspect of the sonnets, especially this one, one of the characters is the speaker
        who is the author and thus has "power" outside of the poem in the shaping of the poem to make it what he wants. 
        To even give the subject immortality.-->
