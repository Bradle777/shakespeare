    <title>ACT 1. SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol</title>

<stage> Flourish. Enter the TRIBUNES and SENATORS aloft; and 
     then enter below SATURNINUS and his followers at one door, and BASSIANUS and his
  followers at the other, with drums and trumpets</stage>
  <sp who="Saturninus" gender="male">SATURNINUS.</sp> <power role="patriarch">Noble patricians, patrons of my right</power>,
    Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
    And, countrymen, my loving followers,
    Plead my successive title with your swords.
    I am his <power role="patriarch">first born son</power> that was the last
    That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
    Then let my <depiction role="protector" gender="male">father's honour</depiction>s live in me,
    Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  <sp who="Bassianus" gender="male">BASSIANUS.</sp> Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,
    If ever <power role="patriarch">Bassianus, Caesar's son</power>,
    Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
    Keep then this passage to the Capitol;
    And suffer not dishonour to approach
    The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
    To justice, continence, and nobility;
    But let desert in pure election shine;
    And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
<stage>Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS aloft, with the crown</stage>
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> <power role="patriarch">Princes</power>, that strive by factions and by friends
    Ambitiously for rule and empery,
    Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
    A special party, have by common voice
    In election for the Roman empery
    Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
    For many good and great deserts to Rome.
    <depiction role="hero" gender="male">A nobler man, a braver warrior,</depiction>
    Lives not this day within the city walls.
    He by the Senate is accited home,
    From weary wars against the <depiction role="villain">barbarous Goths</depiction>,
    That <power role="patriarch">with his sons</power>, a terror to our foes,
    Hath yok'd a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
    Ten years are spent since first he undertook
    This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms
    Our enemies' pride; five times he hath return'd
    <depiction role="hero" gender="male">Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons</depiction>
    In coffins from the field; and at this day
    To the monument of that Andronici
    Done sacrifice of expiation,
    And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths.
    And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,
    Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
    Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
    Let us entreat, by honour of his name
    Whom worthily you would have now succeed,
    And in the Capitol and Senate's right,
    Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
    That you withdraw you and abate your strength,
    Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should,
    Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
  <sp who="Saturninus" gender="male">SATURNINUS.</sp> How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts.
  <sp who="Bassianus" gender="male">BASSIANUS.</sp> Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
    In thy uprightness and integrity,
    And so I love and honour thee and thine,
    Thy <depiction role="hero" gender="male">noble brother Titus and his sons</depiction>,
    And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
    <depiction role="wife" gender="female">Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,</depiction>
    That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
    And to my fortunes and the people's favour
    Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
                                <stage>Exeunt the soldiers of BASSIANUS</stage>
  <sp who="Saturninus" gender="male">SATURNINUS.</sp> Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
    I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
    And to the love and favour of my country
    Commit myself, my person, and the cause.
                               <stage>Exeunt the soldiers of SATURNINUS</stage>
    Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
    As I am confident and kind to thee.
    Open the gates and let me in.
  <sp who="Bassianus" gender="male">BASSIANUS.</sp> Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
                    <stage>[Flourish. They go up into the Senate House]
             Enter a CAPTAIN</stage>
  <sp>CAPTAIN.</sp> Romans, make way. The good Andronicus,
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
    <depiction role="hero" gender="male">Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With honour and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword
    And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.</depiction>
<stage>Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter MARTIUS and MUTIUS, two of TITUS' sons; and then two men bearing a coffin covered with <color is="black" context="death">black</color>; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS, two other sons; then TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA the <power role="matriarch">Queen</power> of Goths, with her three sons, ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, with AARON the Moor, and others, as many as can be. Then set down the coffin and TITUS speaks</stage>  
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
    Lo, as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught
    Returns with precious lading to the bay
    From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
    Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
    To re-salute his country with his tears,
    Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
    Thou great defender of this Capitol,
    Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
    Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
    Half of the number that King Priam had,
    Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
    <tone vibe="sad">These that survive let Rome reward with love;
    These that I bring unto their latest home,
    With burial amongst their ancestors.
    Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
    Titus, unkind, and careless of thine own,
    Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
    To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
    Make way to lay them by their brethren.
                                            <stage>[They open the tomb]</stage>
    There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
    And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars.
    O sacred receptacle of my joys,
    Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
    How many sons hast thou of mine in store
    That thou wilt never render to me more!</tone>
  <sp who="Lucius" gender="male">LUCIUS.</sp> Give us the proudest <power role="victim">prisoner of the Goths</power>,
    That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
    Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
    Before this earthy prison of their bones,
    That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
    Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> I give him you- the noblest that survives,
    The <power role="patriarch">eldest son</power> of this <power role="matriarch">distressed queen</power>.
  <sp who="Tamora" gender="female">TAMORA.</sp> Stay, Roman brethen! Gracious conqueror,
    Victorious Titus, rue the <depiction role="weakness" gender="female">tears I shed</depiction>,
    <depiction role="weakness" gender="female">A mother's tears in passion for her son</depiction>;
    And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
    O, think my son to be as dear to me!
    Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
    To beautify thy triumphs, and return
    Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
    But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
    For valiant doings in their country's cause?
    O, if to fight for king and commonweal
    Were piety in thine, it is in these.
    <tone vibe="begging">Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with <color is="red" context="death">blood.</color>
    Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
    Draw near them then in being merciful.
    Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.
    Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.</tone>
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
    These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld
    Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain
    Religiously they ask a sacrifice.
    To this your son is mark'd, and die he must
    T' appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
  <sp who="Lucius" gender="male">LUCIUS.</sp> <violence type="murder">Away with him, and make a fire straight;
    And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
    Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.</violence>
                                <stage>Exeunt TITUS' SONS, with ALARBUS</stage>
  <sp who="Tamora" gender="female">TAMORA.</sp> O cruel, irreligious piety!
  <sp who="Chiron" gender="male">CHIRON.</sp> Was never Scythia half so barbarous!
  <sp who="Demetrius" gender="male">DEMETRIUS.</sp> Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
    To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.
    Then, madam, stand resolv'd, but hope withal
    The self-same gods that arm'd the <power role="matriarch">Queen of Troy</power>
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
    May favour Tamora, the <power role="matriarch">Queen of Goths-</power>
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was <power role="matriarch">queen</power>-
    To quit the <color is="red" context="savage">bloody wrongs</color> upon her foes.

         MUTIUS, the sons of ANDRONICUS, with their swords <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color></stage>
  <sp who="Lucius" gender="male">LUCIUS.</sp> See, <power role="patriarch">lord and father</power>, how we have perform'd
    Our Roman rites: <violence type="murder">Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
    And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,</violence>
    Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.
    Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,
    And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Let it be so, and let Andronicus
    Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
                 <stage>[Sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb]</stage>
    <tone vibe="sad">In peace and honour rest you here, <depiction role="hero" gender="male">my sons;
    Rome's readiest champions</depiction>, repose you here in rest,
    Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
    Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
    Here grow no damned grudges, here are no storms,
    No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!</tone>

    Lo, at this tomb <depiction role="weakness" gender="female">my tributary tears</depiction>
    I render for my brethren's obsequies;
    <depiction role="submissive" gender="female">And at thy feet I kneel, with tears</depiction> of joy
    Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.
   <depiction role="submissive" gender="female"> O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,</depiction>

    <depiction role="hero" gender="male">Gracious triumpher</depiction> in the eyes of Rome!
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
    You that survive and you that sleep in fame.
    Fair <power role="patriarch">lords</power>, your fortunes are alike in all
    That in your country's service drew your swords;
    But safer triumph is this funeral pomp
    That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness
    And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
    Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
    Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
    Send thee by me, their Tribune and their trust,
    This palliament of <color is="white" context="pure">white and spotless hue;</color>
    And name thee in election for the empire
    With these our late-deceased Emperor's sons:
    Be candidatus then, and put it on,
    And help to set a head on headless Rome.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> A better head <depiction gender="female">her glorious body</depiction> fits
    Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.
    What, should I don this robe and trouble you?
    Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
    To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
    And set abroach new business for you all?
    Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
    And led my country's strength successfully,
    And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
    <power role="patriarch">Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms</power>,
    In right and service of their noble country.
    Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
    But not a sceptre to control the world.
    Upright he held it, <power role="patriarch">lords</power>, that held it last.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
  <sp who="Saturninus" gender="male">SATURNINUS.</sp> Proud and ambitious Tribune, canst thou tell?
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Patience, <power role="patriarch">Prince Saturninus.</power>
  <sp who="Saturninus" gender="male">SATURNINUS.</sp> Romans, do me right.
    <power role="patriarch">Patricians</power>, draw your swords, and sheathe them not
    Till Saturninus be Rome's Emperor.
    Andronicus, would thou were shipp'd to hell
    Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
  <sp who="Lucius" gender="male">LUCIUS.</sp> Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
    That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Content thee, <power role="patriarch">Prince</power>; I will restore to thee
    The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
  <sp who="Bassianus" gender="male">BASSIANUS.</sp> Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
    But <depiction role="protector" gender="male">honour</depiction> thee, and will do till I die.
    My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
    I will most thankful be; and thanks to <depiction gender="male">men
    Of noble minds</depiction> is <depiction role="protector" gender="male">honourable</depiction> meed.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> People of Rome, and people's Tribunes here,
    I ask your voices and your suffrages:
    Will ye bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
  <sp>TRIBUNES.</sp> To gratify the good Andronicus,
    And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
    The people will accept whom he admits.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make,
    That you create our <power role="patriarch">Emperor's eldest son</power>,
    <power role="patriarch">Lord</power> Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
    Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
    And ripen justice in this commonweal.
    Then, if you will elect by my advice,
    Crown him, and say 'Long live our Emperor!'
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> With voices and applause of every sort,
    Patricians and plebeians, we create

  <sp who="Saturninus" gender="male">SATURNINUS.</sp> Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
    To us in our election this day
    I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
    And will with deeds requite thy gentleness;

    My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners,
    Presents well worthy <power role="patriarch">Rome's imperious lord</power>;
    Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
    Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.

    Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills,

    And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long

  <sp who="Tamora" gender="female">TAMORA.</sp> My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad
    When everything does make a gleeful boast?
    The birds chant melody on every bush;
    The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun;
    The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
    And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground;
    Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
    And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
    Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns,
    As if a double hunt were heard at once,
    Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
    And- after conflict such as was suppos'd
    The wand'ring <power role="patriarch">prince</power> and Dido once enjoyed,
    When with a happy storm they were surpris'd,
    And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave-
    <love action="physical">We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,</love>
    Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,
    Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds

    Even as an adder when she doth unroll
    <violence type="murder">To do some fatal execution?</violence>
    No, madam, these are no venereal signs.
    <depiction role="villain" gender="male">Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,

    Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,

    Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had,
    Thy temples should be planted presently
    With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
    Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
    Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  <sp who="Lavinia" gender="female">LAVINIA.</sp> Under your patience, gentle Empress,
    'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
    And to be doubted that <depiction role="race">your Moor</depiction> and you
    Are singled forth to try thy experiments.
    Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!

    Why are you sequest'red from all your train,

    Accompanied but with a <depiction role="race">barbarous Moor</depiction>,
    If foul desire had not conducted you?
  <sp who="Lavinia" gender="female">LAVINIA.</sp> And, being intercepted in your sport,

    For sauciness. I pray you let us hence,

<stage>Enter CHIRON and DEMETRIUS</stage>
  <sp who="Demetrius" gender="male">DEMETRIUS.</sp> How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
    Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan?
  <sp who="Tamora" gender="female">TAMORA.</sp> Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
    These two have 'ticed me hither to this place.
    A barren detested vale you see it is:
    The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
    Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe;
    Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
    Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.
    And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
    They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
    A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
    Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
    Would make such fearful and confused cries
    As any mortal body hearing it
    Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly.
    No sooner had they told this hellish tale
    <depiction role="manipulation" gender="female">But straight they told me they would bind me here
    Unto the body of a dismal yew,
    And leave me to this miserable death.</depiction>
    And then they call'd me <violence type="insult">foul adulteress,
    Lascivious Goth</violence>, and all the bitterest terms
    That ever ear did hear to such effect;
    And had you not by wondrous fortune come,
    This vengeance on me had they executed.
    <depiction role="manipulation" gender="female">Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,

    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness
    As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    Alas, a <color is="red" context="death">crimson river of warm blood,</color>
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.
    But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
    Ah, now <depiction role="impure" gender="female">thou turn'st away thy face for shame</depiction>!
    And notwithstanding all this loss of <color is="red" context="death">blood-</color>
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts-
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue,
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
    And he hath <depiction role="pure" gender="female">cut those pretty fingers off</depiction>
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen <depiction role="pure" gender="female">those lily hands
    Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,</depiction>
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep,
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye;
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,
    What will <depiction role="weakness" gender="male">whole months of tears thy father's eyes?</depiction>
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee;
    O, could our mourning case thy misery! <stage>Exeunt</stage>

    <tone vibe="sad">For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' <color is="red" context="death">sweet blood </color>will make it <depiction role="impure">shame and blush.</depiction>
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.

<stage>Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn</stage>
    O reverend Tribunes! O gentle aged men!
    Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,
    And let me say, that never wept before,
    My <depiction role="weakness" gender="male">tears</depiction> are now prevailing orators.</tone></tone>
  <sp who="Lucius" gender="male">LUCIUS.</sp> O noble father, you lament in vain;

    <depiction role="insanity" gender="male">And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</depiction>
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead!
    Grave Tribunes, once more I entreat of you.
  <sp who="Lucius" gender="male">LUCIUS.</sp> My gracious <power role="patriarch">lord</power>, no tribune hears you speak.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp><tone vibe="sad"> Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
    They would not mark me; if they did mark,
    They would not pity me; yet plead I must,
    And bootless unto them.
    Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
    Who though they cannot answer my distress,
    Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes,
    For that they will not intercept my tale.
    When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
    <depiction role="weakness" gender="male">Receive my tears</depiction>, and seem to weep with me;
    And were they but attired in grave weeds,
    Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.
    A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
    A stone is silent and offendeth not,
    And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</tone>

    Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
    That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
    Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
    But me and mine; how happy art thou then
    From these devourers to be banished!
    But who comes with our brother Marcus here?

  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
    Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
    Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
    What fool hath added water to the sea,
    Or <depiction role="impure">brought a fagot</depiction> to bright-burning Troy?
    My grief was at the height before thou cam'st,
    And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.
    Give me a sword, I'll chop off my <power gender="male">hands</power>too,
    For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
    And they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life;
    In bootless prayer have they been held up,
    And they have serv'd me to effectless use.
    Now all the service I require of them
    Is that the one will help to cut the other.
    'Tis well, Lavinia, that <power role="weakness" gender="female">thou hast no hands</power>;
    For hands to do Rome service is but vain.
  <sp who="Lucius" gender="male">LUCIUS.</sp> Speak, <depiction role="weakness" gender="female">gentle sister</depiction>, who hath martyr'd thee?
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
    That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence

    Expecting ever when some envious surge
    Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
    <power role="patriarch">This way to death my wretched sons are gone;

    But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
    Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.

    Look, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!

    Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
    And thou and I sit round about some fountain,
    Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
    How they are stain'd, like meadows yet not dry
    With miry slime left on them by a flood?
    And in the fountain shall we gaze so long,

  <sp who="Lucius" gender="male">LUCIUS.</sp> Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.

    Then thus I thump it down.
   <stage> [To LAVINIA]</stage> Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
    When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
    Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
    Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
    Or get some little knife between thy teeth
    And just against thy heart make thou a hole,
    That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
    May run into that sink and, soaking in,
    <depiction role="weakness">Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears</depiction>.</tone>

  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
    Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
    <power role="weakness" gender="female">What violent handscan she lay on her life?</power>
    Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands?
    To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er
    How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
    O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
    Lest we remember still that we have none.
    Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
    As if we should forget we had no hands,
    If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
    Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
    Here is no drink. Hark, Marcus, what she says-
    I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
    She says <depiction role="weakness" gender="female">she drinks no other drink but tears</depiction>,
    Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks.
    Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
    In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
    As begging hermits in their holy prayers.
    Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
    Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
    But I of these will wrest an alphabet,
    And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.
  <sp>BOY.</sp> Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments;

    <title>ACT IV. SCENE I. Rome. TITUS' garden</title>

<stage>Enter YOUNG LUCIUS and LAVINIA running after him, and the boy flies from her with his books under his arm.</stage>
<stage>Enter TITUS and MARCUS</stage>
  <sp>BOY.</sp> Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
    Follows me everywhere, I know not why.
    Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes!
    Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  <sp>BOY.</sp> Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
    See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee.
    Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
    Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
    Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
    Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
  <sp>BOY.</sp> My <power role="patriarch">lord</power>, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
    <depiction role="insanity" gender="female">Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;</depiction>
    For I have heard my grandsire say full oft
    Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
    And I have read that <depiction role="insanity" gender="female">Hecuba of Troy
    Ran mad for sorrow</depiction>. That made me to fear;
    Although, my <power role="patriarch">lord</power>, I know my noble aunt
    Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
    And would not, but in fury, fright my youth;
    Which made me down to throw my books, and fly-
    Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt;
    And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
    I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> Lucius, I will. 
                     <stage>[LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which Lucius has let fall]</stage>
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
    Some book there is that she desires to see.
    Which is it, girl, of these?- Open them, boy.-
    But thou art deeper read and better skill'd;
    Come and take choice of all my library,
    And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
    Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
    Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> I think she means that there were more than one
    Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was,
    <violence type="threat" gender="female">Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.</violence>
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
  <sp>BOY.</sp> Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
    My mother gave it me.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> For love of her that's gone,
    Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
    What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
    This is the tragic tale of Philomel
    And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape;
    And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> <depiction role="weakness" gender="female">Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
    Ravish'd and wrong'd as Philomela was,
    Forc'd in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?</depiction>
    See, see!
    Ay, such a place there is where we did hunt-
    O, had we never, never hunted there!-
    Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
    <depiction role="villain">By nature made for murders and for rapes.</depiction>
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> O, why should nature build so foul a den,
    Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
    What Roman <power role="patriarch">lord</power> it was durst do the deed.
    Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
    That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me.
    Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
    Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
    My <power role="patriarch">lord</power>, look here! Look here, Lavinia!

    This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst,
    This after me. I have writ my name
    Without the help of any hand at all.
    Curs'd be that heart that forc'd us to this shift!
    Write thou, good niece, and here display at last
    What God will have discovered for revenge.
    Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
    That we may know the <depiction role="villain" gender="male">traitors</depiction> and the truth!

  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> O, calm thee, gentle <power role="patriarch">lord</power>! although I know
    There is enough written upon this earth
    To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts,
    And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
    My <power role="patriarch">lord</power>, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
    And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
    And swear with me- as, with the woeful fere

<stage>Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters on the ends of them; with him MARCUS, YOUNG LUCIUS, and other gentlemen, PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, and CAIUS, with bows</stage>
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.
    Sir boy, let me see your archery;
    Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
    Terras Astrea reliquit,
    Be you rememb'red, Marcus; she's gone, she's fled.
    Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
    Go sound the ocean and cast your nets;
    Happily you may catch her in the sea;
    Yet there's as little justice as at land.
    No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;
    'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
    And pierce the inmost centre of the earth;
    Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
    I pray you deliver him this petition.
    Tell him it is for justice and for aid,
    And that it comes from old Andronicus,
    Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
    Ah, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable
    What time I threw the people's suffrages
    On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
    Go get you gone; and pray be careful all,
    And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd.
    This wicked Emperor may have shipp'd her hence;
    And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
    To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
  <sp>PUBLIUS.</sp> Therefore, my <power role="patriarch">lords</power>, it highly us concerns

    What, have you met with her?
  <sp>PUBLIUS.</sp> No, my good <power role="patriarch">lord</power>; but Pluto sends you word,
    If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall.
    Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,
    He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
    So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
    I'll dive into the burning lake below
    And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
    Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,
    No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size;
    But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
    <depiction role="weakness" gender="male">Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear;</depiction>
    And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
    We will solicit heaven, and move the gods
    To send down justice for to wreak our wrongs.
    Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus.
                                      <stage>[He gives them the arrows]</stage>
    'Ad Jovem' that's for you; here 'Ad Apollinem.'
    'Ad Martem' that's for myself.
    Here, boy, 'To Pallas'; here 'To Mercury.'
    'To Saturn,' Caius- not to Saturnine:
    You were as good to shoot against the wind.
    To it, boy. Marcus, loose when I bid.
    Of my word, I have written to effect;
    There's not a god left unsolicited.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court;

    Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> Ha! ha!
    Publius, Publius, hast thou done?
    See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.
  <sp who="Marcus Andronicus" gender="male">MARCUS.</sp> This was the sport, my <power role="patriarch">lord</power>: when Publius shot,
    The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock
    That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
    <depiction role="villain" gender="female">And who should find them but the <power role="matriarch">Empress'</power> villain?

    again, for the man must not be hang'd till the next week.
  <sp who="Titus Andronicus" gender="male">TITUS.</sp> But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?

    O, let me teach you how to knit again
    This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,
    These broken limbs again into one body;
    Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
    And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
    Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
    Do shameful execution on herself.
    But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
    Grave witnesses of true experience,
    Cannot induce you to attend my words,
   <stage> [To Lucius]</stage> Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
    When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
    To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
    The story of that baleful burning night,
    When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy.
    Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
    Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
    That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
    My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
    Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
    But floods of <depiction role="weakness" gender="male">tears</depiction> will drown my oratory

    <depiction role="hero" gender="male">That my report is just and full of truth.</depiction>
