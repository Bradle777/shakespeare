# Group meeting updates

- markup was pretty satisfactory, marked up characters (10)
- regex was very helpful!
- some manual tagging for beginning and ending
- markup for the characteristics was a little difficult 
    - need group markup to decide tone 

# New markup for: 
- patriarchal norms 
    - `<power>` element
        - `type` attribute = ("patriarch", "race", "class") 
- possibly adding a speaker element, to define character more 
    - `<sp>` as element, `chara` as attribute 

# Some things: 
- *our meetings are every monday at 1:00 PM* -- this means, your work for the week should be pushed by then. otherwise, you're impacting other people who did do the work, and we have to wait until you catch up to address things with the group as a whole

- by next week, i expect the entire texts to be marked up with presentational and descriptive markup

- then, i'll have you guys review each other's markup for homework to ensure that you guys are all on the right track

- comments are your friend! if you run into something funky that you want to talk about, leave a comment about it in your file

- a note on grades: project grades are assigned *individually* based on contributions. keep this in mind when staying up to date on work
