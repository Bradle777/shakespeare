# meeting notes 6

- no longer doing "as you like it" or "much ado about nothing"
    - sad, but anything to do? want to still include? should be fine without
- relax ng is great! i made a new folder for it in our repo to keep things organized
- html updates?


- adding in some sonnets

- changes to markup?
    - `<sp chara="">` to be changed to `who` attribute: `<sp who="">`
- plan out website 
    - homepage: include overview/background, research questions, team info
        - mention typical stereotypes in shakespearean / elizabethan era
    - methodology: explaining your markup and elements
    - texts page
    - analysis page
    - conclusion page, bibliography
- soon we'll make a css page for our website: colors? fonts? or play as we go? 
    - someone eventually will have to find pics to use / include, but for now, focus on basic skeleton
    - picture for the background and scrolling 


- for next week: lily, go over relax-ng and make updates as needed. from what i saw, it looks like there might need to be some text additions, and some things to add to the metadata
- bradley: make a methodology page
- both: make sure your texts are valid against the schema, add more markup as needed
- some sonnets to go over (i'll help with)
