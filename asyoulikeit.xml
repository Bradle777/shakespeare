ACT I

SCENE I. An Orchard near <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver's</chara> house
Enter Orlando and <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male"><chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara></chara>.
As I remember, <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>, it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou sayst, charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara> he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping, for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for, besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
Enter <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver</chara>.
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Go apart, <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.
[<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara> retires.]
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Now, sir, what make you here?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Nothing. I am not taught to make anything.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
What mar you then, sir?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Know you where you are, sir?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Know you before whom, sir?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first-born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
What, boy!
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I am no villain. I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so. Thou has railed on thyself.
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
[Coming forward.] Sweet masters, be patient. For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Let me go, I say.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charged you in his will to give me good education. You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it. Therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
And what wilt thou do? Beg when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you. You shall have some part of your will. I pray you leave me.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Get you with him, you old dog.
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
Is “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master. He would not have spoke such a word.
[Exeunt Orlando and <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>.]
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla, <chara name= "Dennis" gender= "male">Dennis</chara>!
[Enter <chara name= "Dennis" gender= "male">Dennis</chara>.]
<chara name= "Dennis" gender= "male">DENNIS</chara>
Calls your worship?
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Was not <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>, the Duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
<chara name= "Dennis" gender= "male">DENNIS</chara>
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Call him in.
[Exit <chara name= "Dennis" gender= "male">Dennis</chara>.]
’Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.
Enter <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>.
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">CHARLES</chara>.
Good morrow to your worship.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Good Monsieur <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>. What’s the new news at the new court?
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">CHARLES</chara>.
There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">CHARLES</chara>.
O, no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies loved as they do.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Where will the old Duke live?
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">CHARLES</chara>.
They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke?
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">CHARLES</chara>.
Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honour if he come in. Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some indirect means or other. For I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">CHARLES</chara>.
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow I’ll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship.
[Exit.]
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Farewell, good <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul—yet I know not why—hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprized. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about.
[Exit.]
SCENE II. A Lawn before the Duke’s Palace
Enter Rosalind and <chara name= "<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Dear <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine. So wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honour I will! And when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see—what think you of falling in love?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
What shall be our sport, then?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I would we could do so, for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favouredly.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.
Enter <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
No? When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the cutter-off of Nature’s wit.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.—How now, wit, whither wander you?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Mistress, you must come away to your father.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Were you made the messenger?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Where learned you that oath, fool?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught. Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Prithee, who is’t that thou mean’st?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
My father’s love is enough to honour him. Enough! Speak no more of him. You’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
By my troth, thou sayest true. For since the little wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur <chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">Le Beau</chara>.
Enter <chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">Le Beau</chara>.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
With his mouth full of news.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Then shall we be news-crammed.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
Bonjour, Monsieur <chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">Le Beau</chara>. What’s the news?
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Sport! Of what colour?
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
As wit and fortune will.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Or as the destinies decrees.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Well said. That was laid on with a trowel.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Nay, if I keep not my rank—
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Thou losest thy old smell.
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
I will tell you the beginning and, if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
There comes an old man and his three sons—
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.”
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
The eldest of the three wrestled with <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>, the Duke’s wrestler, which <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara> in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he served the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Alas!
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
Why, this that I speak of.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Or I, I promise thee.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.
Flourish. Enter <chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">Duke Frederick</chara>, Lords, Orlando, <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara> and Attendants.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Come on. Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Is yonder the man?
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
Even he, madam.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Alas, he is too young. Yet he looks successfully.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
How now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger’s youth I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Call him hither, good Monsieur <chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">Le Beau</chara>.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Do so; I’ll not be by.
[<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">Duke Frederick</chara> steps aside.]
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I attend them with all respect and duty.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Young man, have you challenged <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara> the wrestler?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
No, fair princess. He is the general challenger. I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgement, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Do, young sir. Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized. We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies anything. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that is willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
And mine to eke out hers.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceived in you.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Your heart’s desires be with you.
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">CHARLES</chara>.
Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
You shall try but one fall.
<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">CHARLES</chara>.
No, I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
You mean to mock me after; you should not have mocked me before. But come your ways.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.
[Orlando and <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara> wrestle.]
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
O excellent young man!
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.
[<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara> is thrown. Shout.]
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
No more, no more.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Yes, I beseech your grace. I am not yet well breathed.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
How dost thou, <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>?
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
He cannot speak, my lord.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Bear him away.
[<chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara> is carried off by Attendants.]
What is thy name, young man?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
The world esteemed thy father honourable,
But I did find him still mine enemy.
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed
Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth.
I would thou hadst told me of another father.
[Exeunt <chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">Duke Frederick</chara>, <chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">Le Beau</chara> and Lords.]
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,
His youngest son, and would not change that calling
To be adopted heir to Frederick.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
And all the world was of my father’s mind.
Had I before known this young man his son,
I should have given him tears unto entreaties
Ere he should thus have ventured.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Gentle cousin,
Let us go thank him and encourage him.
My father’s rough and envious disposition
Sticks me at heart.—Sir, you have well deserved.
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly, as you have exceeded promise,
Your mistress shall be happy.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Gentleman,
[Giving him a chain from her neck.]
Wear this for me—one out of suits with Fortune,
That could give more but that her hand lacks means.—
Shall we go, coz?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Ay.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes.
I’ll ask him what he would.—Did you call, sir?—
Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
More than your enemies.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Will you go, coz?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Have with you.—Fare you well.
[Exeunt Rosalind and <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>.]
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown.
Or <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara> or something weaker masters thee.
Enter <chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">Le Beau</chara>.
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
High commendation, true applause, and love,
Yet such is now the Duke’s condition
That he misconsters all that you have done.
The Duke is humorous; what he is indeed
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
Which of the two was daughter of the Duke
That here was at the wrestling?
<chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">LE BEAU</chara>.
Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,
But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter.
The other is daughter to the banished Duke,
And here detained by her usurping uncle
To keep his daughter company, whose loves
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
But I can tell you that of late this Duke
Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece,
Grounded upon no other argument
But that the people praise her for her virtues
And pity her for her good father’s sake;
And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady
Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.
Hereafter, in a better world than this,
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I rest much bounden to you; fare you well!
[Exit <chara name= "Le Beau" gender= "male">Le Beau</chara>.]
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,
From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.
But heavenly Rosalind!
[Exit.]
SCENE III. A Room in the Palace
Enter <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara> and Rosalind.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Why, cousin, why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! Not a word?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Not one to throw at a dog.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs. Throw some of them at me. Come, lame me with reasons.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
But is all this for your father?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
No, some of it is for my child’s father. O, how full of briers is this working-day world!
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery. If we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I could shake them off my coat; these burs are in my heart.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Hem them away.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of a fall. But turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
The Duke my father loved his father dearly.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
Enter <chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">Duke Frederick</chara> with Lords.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.—Look, here comes the Duke.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
With his eyes full of anger.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
And get you from our court.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Me, uncle?
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
You, cousin.
Within these ten days if that thou be’st found
So near our public court as twenty miles,
Thou diest for it.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I do beseech your Grace,
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
If with myself I hold intelligence,
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
If that I do not dream, or be not frantic—
As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle,
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your Highness.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Thus do all traitors.
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace itself.
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Thou art thy father’s daughter, there’s enough.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banished him.
Treason is not inherited, my lord,
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
What’s that to me? My father was no traitor.
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Ay, <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>, we stayed her for your sake,
Else had she with her father ranged along.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse.
I was too young that time to value her,
But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
Why, so am I. We still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learned, played, ate together,
And wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans,
Still we went coupled and inseparable.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
She is too subtle for thee, and her smoothness,
Her very silence, and her patience
Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name,
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Which I have passed upon her. She is banished.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.
I cannot live out of her company.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
If you outstay the time, upon mine honour
And in the greatness of my word, you die.
[Exeunt <chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">Duke Frederick</chara> and Lords.]
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I have more cause.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Thou hast not, cousin.
Prithee be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke
Hath banished me, his daughter?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
That he hath not.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
Shall we be sundered? Shall we part, sweet girl?
No, let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Whither to go, and what to bear with us,
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out.
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Why, whither shall we go?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Alas, what danger will it be to us,
Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire,
And with a kind of umber smirch my face.
The like do you; so shall we pass along
And never stir assailants.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Were it not better,
Because that I am more than common tall,
That I did suit me all points like a man?
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh,
A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart
Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will,
We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside,
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be called?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Something that hath a reference to my state:
No longer <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Celia<chara>, but <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Aliena<chara>.
ROSALIND.
But, cousin, what if we assayed to steal
The clownish fool out of your father’s court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me.
Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away,
And get our jewels and our wealth together,
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight. Now go we in content
To liberty, and not to banishment.
[Exeunt.]
ACT II

SCENE I. The Forest of Arden
[Enter <chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">Duke Senior</chara>, <chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">Amiens</chara> and two or three Lords, dressed as foresters.]
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we not the penalty of <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>,
The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,
Which when it bites and blows upon my body
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say:
“This is no flattery. These are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.”
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
I would not change it. Happy is your grace,
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should in their own confines with forked heads
Have their round haunches gored.
FIRST LORD.
Indeed, my lord,
The melancholy <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara> grieves at that,
And in that kind swears you do more usurp
Than doth your brother that hath banished you.
Today my lord of <chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">Amiens</chara> and myself
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;
To the which place a poor sequestered stag,
That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,
Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,
Much marked of the melancholy <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>,
Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,
Augmenting it with tears.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
But what said <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
FIRST LORD.
O yes, into a thousand similes.
First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
“Poor deer,” quoth he “thou mak’st a testament
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
To that which had too much.” Then, being there alone,
Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
“’Tis right”; quoth he, “thus misery doth part
The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>,
“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens!
’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
The body of the country, city, court,
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,
To fright the animals and to kill them up
In their assigned and native dwelling-place.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
SECOND LORD.
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
Upon the sobbing deer.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Show me the place.
I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
For then he’s full of matter.
FIRST LORD.
I’ll bring you to him straight.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. A Room in the Palace
Enter <chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">Duke Frederick</chara> with Lords.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be! Some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this.
FIRST LORD.
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
Saw her abed, and in the morning early
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
SECOND LORD.
My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
Hesperia, the princess’ gentlewoman,
Confesses that she secretly o’erheard
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
The parts and graces of the wrestler
That did but lately foil the sinewy <chara name= "Charles" gender= "male">Charles</chara>;
And she believes wherever they are gone
That youth is surely in their company.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
If he be absent, bring his brother to me.
I’ll make him find him. Do this suddenly!
And let not search and inquisition quail
To bring again these foolish runaways.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Before <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver</chara>’s House
Enter Orlando and <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>, meeting.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Who’s there?
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
What, my young master? O my gentle master,
O my sweet master, O you memory
Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
O, what a world is this, when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it!
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Why, what’s the matter?
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
O unhappy youth,
Come not within these doors! Within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives.
Your brother—no, no brother, yet the son—
Yet not the son; I will not call him son—
Of him I was about to call his father,
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
And you within it. If he fail of that,
He will have other means to cut you off;
I overheard him and his practices.
This is no place; this house is but a butchery.
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Why, whither, <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>, wouldst thou have me go?
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
No matter whither, so you come not here.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
A thievish living on the common road?
This I must do, or know not what to do.
Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
And unregarded age in corners thrown.
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Be comfort to my age. Here is the gold.
All this I give you. Let me be your servant.
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility.
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty but kindly. Let me go with you.
I’ll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
O good old man, how well in thee appears
The constant service of the antique world,
When service sweat for duty, not for meed.
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
Where none will sweat but for promotion,
And having that do choke their service up
Even with the having. It is not so with thee.
But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree,
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
But come thy ways, we’ll go along together,
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
We’ll light upon some settled low content.
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
Master, go on and I will follow thee
To the last gasp with truth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Here lived I, but now live here no more.
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
But at fourscore it is too late a week.
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well and not my master’s debtor.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden
Enter Rosalind as Ganymede, <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Celia<chara> as <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Aliena<chara>, and <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man’s apparel, and to cry like a woman, but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat. Therefore, courage, good <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Aliena<chara>.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
I pray you bear with me, I cannot go no further.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you. Yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Well, this is the forest of Arden.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I! When I was at home I was in a better place, but travellers must be content.
Enter <chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">Corin</chara> and <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Ay, be so, good <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>. Look you, who comes here? A young man and an old in solemn talk.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
O <chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">Corin</chara>, that thou knew’st how I do love her!
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
No, <chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">Corin</chara>, being old, thou canst not guess,
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.
But if thy love were ever like to mine—
As sure I think did never man love so—
How many actions most ridiculous
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly
That ever love did make thee run into,
Thou hast not loved.
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise,
Thou hast not loved.
Or if thou hast not broke from company
Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
Thou hast not loved.
O <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!</chara>
[Exit <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.]
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,
I have by hard adventure found mine own.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
And I mine. I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batlet, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked; and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods, and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers. But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion
Is much upon my fashion.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
And mine, but it grows something stale with me.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
I pray you, one of you question yond man
If he for gold will give us any food.
I faint almost to death.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Holla, you clown!
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Peace, fool, he’s not thy kinsman.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Who calls?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Your betters, sir.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Else are they very wretched.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Peace, I say.—Good even to you, friend.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
Here’s a young maid with travel much oppressed,
And faints for succour.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Fair sir, I pity her
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
My fortunes were more able to relieve her.
But I am shepherd to another man
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
My master is of churlish disposition
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality.
Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed
Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
By reason of his absence, there is nothing
That you will feed on. But what is, come see,
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
That little cares for buying anything.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
And willingly could waste my time in it.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
Go with me. If you like upon report
The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
I will your very faithful feeder be,
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE V. Another part of the Forest
Enter <chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">Amiens</chara>, <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara> and others.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
[Sings.]
        Under the greenwood tree,
        Who loves to lie with me
        And turn his merry note
        Unto the sweet bird’s throat,
    Come hither, come hither, come hither!
        Here shall he see
        No enemy
    But winter and rough weather.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
More, more, I prithee, more.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo. Call you ’em stanzos?
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
What you will, Monsieur <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me nothing. Will you sing?
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
More at your request than to please myself.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th’ encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while. The Duke will drink under this tree; he hath been all this day to look you.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them. Come, warble, come.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
[Sings.]
        Who doth ambition shun
        And loves to live i’ th’ sun,
        Seeking the food he eats
        And pleased with what he gets,
    Come hither, come hither, come hither.
        Here shall he see
        No enemy
    But winter and rough weather.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
And I’ll sing it.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Thus it goes:
        If it do come to pass
        That any man turn ass,
        Leaving his wealth and ease
        A stubborn will to please,
    Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
        Here shall he see
        Gross fools as he,
    An if he will come to me.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
What’s that “ducdame?”
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
’Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle. I’ll go sleep if I can; if I cannot, I’ll rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>.
And I’ll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepared.
[Exeunt severally.]
SCENE VI. Another part of the Forest
Enter Orlando and <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>.
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie I down and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Why, how now, Adam? No greater heart in thee? Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my sake, be comfortable. Hold death awhile at the arm’s end. I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I’ll give thee leave to die. But if thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said, thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert. Cheerly, good <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>!
[Exeunt.]
SCENE VII. Another part of the Forest
Enter <chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">Duke Senior</chara>, <chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">Amiens</chara> and Lords as outlaws.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
I think he be transformed into a beast,
For I can nowhere find him like a man.
FIRST LORD.
My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Go seek him, tell him I would speak with him.
[Enter <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>.]
FIRST LORD.
He saves my labour by his own approach.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Why, how now, monsieur? What a life is this
That your poor friends must woo your company?
What, you look merrily.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
A fool, a fool! I met a fool i’ th’ forest,
A motley fool. A miserable world!
As I do live by food, I met a fool,
Who laid him down and basked him in the sun,
And railed on Lady Fortune in good terms,
In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.
“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,
“Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.”
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
Says very wisely, “It is ten o’clock.
Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.
’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.
And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,
And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear
The motley fool thus moral on the time,
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
What fool is this?
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
O worthy fool!—One that hath been a courtier,
And says if ladies be but young and fair,
They have the gift to know it. And in his brain,
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
After a voyage, he hath strange places crammed
With observation, the which he vents
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Thou shalt have one.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
It is my only suit,
Provided that you weed your better judgements
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise. I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.
And they that are most galled with my folly,
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
The “why” is plain as way to parish church.
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not,
The wise man’s folly is anatomized
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley. Give me leave
To speak my mind, and I will through and through
Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,
If they will patiently receive my medicine.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
What, for a counter, would I do but good?
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
As sensual as the brutish sting itself,
And all th’ embossed sores and headed evils
That thou with license of free foot hast caught
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Why, who cries out on pride
That can therein tax any private party?
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
Till that the weary very means do ebb?
What woman in the city do I name
When that I say the city-woman bears
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
Who can come in and say that I mean her,
When such a one as she, such is her neighbour?
Or what is he of basest function
That says his bravery is not on my cost,
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
His folly to the mettle of my speech?
There then. How then, what then? Let me see wherein
My tongue hath wronged him. If it do him right,
Then he hath wronged himself. If he be free,
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies
Unclaimed of any man. But who comes here?
Enter Orlando with sword drawn.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Forbear, and eat no more.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Why, I have eat none yet.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Nor shalt not till necessity be served.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Of what kind should this cock come of?
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress?
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
That in civility thou seem’st so empty?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
You touched my vein at first. The thorny point
Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show
Of smooth civility; yet am I inland bred
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say!
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I almost die for food, and let me have it.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.
I thought that all things had been savage here
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of stern commandment. But whate’er you are
That in this desert inaccessible,
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time,
If ever you have looked on better days,
If ever been where bells have knolled to church,
If ever sat at any good man’s feast,
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear,
And know what ’tis to pity and be pitied,
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,
In the which hope I blush and hide my sword.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
True is it that we have seen better days,
And have with holy bell been knolled to church,
And sat at good men’s feasts, and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.
And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be ministered.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Then but forbear your food a little while,
Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
And give it food. There is an old poor man
Who after me hath many a weary step
Limped in pure love. Till he be first sufficed,
Oppressed with two weak evils, age and hunger,
I will not touch a bit.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Go find him out,
And we will nothing waste till you return.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort.
[Exit.]
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.
This wide and universal theatre
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
Enter Orlando bearing <chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">Adam</chara>.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Welcome. Set down your venerable burden,
And let him feed.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I thank you most for him.
<chara name= "Adam" gender= "male">ADAM</chara>.
So had you need;
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Welcome, fall to. I will not trouble you
As yet to question you about your fortunes.
Give us some music, and good cousin, sing.
SONG.

<chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">AMIENS</chara>. (Sings.)
        Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
        Thou art not so unkind
            As man’s ingratitude.
        Thy tooth is not so keen,
        Because thou art not seen,
            Although thy breath be rude.
Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
        Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
            This life is most jolly.
        Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
        That dost not bite so nigh
            As benefits forgot.
        Though thou the waters warp,
        Thy sting is not so sharp
            As friend remembered not.
Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho, unto the green holly.
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
        Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
            This life is most jolly.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son,
As you have whispered faithfully you were,
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
Most truly limned and living in your face,
Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
That loved your father. The residue of your fortune
Go to my cave and tell me.—Good old man,
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Support him by the arm. [To Orlando.] Give me your hand,
And let me all your fortunes understand.
[Exeunt.]
ACT III

SCENE I. A Room in the Palace
Enter <chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">Duke Frederick</chara>, Lords and <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver</chara>.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be.
But were I not the better part made mercy,
I should not seek an absent argument
Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
Find out thy brother wheresoe’er he is.
Seek him with candle. Bring him dead or living
Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands, and all things that thou dost call thine
Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands,
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth
Of what we think against thee.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
O that your highness knew my heart in this:
I never loved my brother in my life.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">DUKE FREDERICK</chara>.
More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors,
And let my officers of such a nature
Make an extent upon his house and lands.
Do this expediently, and turn him going.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. The Forest of Arden
Enter Orlando with a paper.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love.
     And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
     Thy huntress’ name that my full life doth sway.
O Rosalind, these trees shall be my books,
     And in their barks my thoughts I’ll character,
That every eye which in this forest looks
     Shall see thy virtue witnessed everywhere.
Run, run, Orlando, carve on every tree
The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.
[Exit.]
Enter <chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">Corin</chara> and <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
No, truly.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Then thou art damned.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Nay, I hope.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Truly, thou art damned, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
For not being at court? Your reason.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Not a whit, <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands. That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Instance, briefly. Come, instance.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say. Come.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Besides, our hands are hard.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance, come.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Most shallow man! Thou worm’s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise and perpend. Civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
You have too courtly a wit for me. I’ll rest.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee, thou art raw.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Sir, I am a true labourer. I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou be’st not damned for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds. I cannot see else how thou shouldst ’scape.
Enter Rosalind as Ganymede.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
[Reads.]
         From the east to western Inde
         No jewel is like Rosalind.
         Her worth being mounted on the wind,
         Through all the world bears Rosalind.
         All the pictures fairest lined
         Are but black to Rosalind.
         Let no face be kept in mind
         But the fair of Rosalind.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
I’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted. It is the right butter-women’s rank to market.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Out, fool!
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
         For a taste:
         If a hart do lack a hind,
         Let him seek out Rosalind.
         If the cat will after kind,
         So be sure will Rosalind.
         Winter garments must be lined,
         So must slender Rosalind.
         They that reap must sheaf and bind,
         Then to cart with Rosalind.
         Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
         Such a nut is Rosalind.
         He that sweetest rose will find
         Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.
This is the very false gallop of verses. Why do you infect yourself with them?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Peace, you dull fool, I found them on a tree.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I’ll graft it with you, and then I shall graft it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i’ th’ country, for you’ll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that’s the right virtue of the medlar.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.
Enter <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Celia<chara> as <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Aliena<chara>, reading a paper.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Peace, here comes my sister, reading. Stand aside.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
[Reads.]
            Why should this a desert be?
                For it is unpeopled? No!
            Tongues I’ll hang on every tree
                That shall civil sayings show.
            Some, how brief the life of man
                Runs his erring pilgrimage,
            That the streching of a span
                Buckles in his sum of age;
            Some, of violated vows
                ’Twixt the souls of friend and friend.
            But upon the fairest boughs,
                Or at every sentence’ end,
            Will I “Rosalinda” write,
                Teaching all that read to know
            The quintessence of every sprite
                Heaven would in little show.
            Therefore heaven nature charged
                That one body should be filled
            With all graces wide-enlarged.
                Nature presently distilled
            Helen’s cheek, but not her heart,
                Cleopatra’s majesty;
            Atalanta’s better part,
                Sad Lucretia’s modesty.
            Thus Rosalind of many parts
                By heavenly synod was devised,
            Of many faces, eyes, and hearts
                To have the touches dearest prized.
            Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
                And I to live and die her slave.

O most gentle Jupiter, what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried “Have patience, good people!”
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
How now! Back, friends. Shepherd, go off a little. Go with him, sirrah.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat, though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.

<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
Didst thou hear these verses?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
That’s no matter. The feet might bear the verses.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so berhymed since Pythagoras’ time that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
Trow you who hath done this?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Is it a man?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. Change you colour?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I prithee, who?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Nay, but who is it?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
Is it possible?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Good my complexion! Dost thou think, though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery. I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
So you may put a man in your belly.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Is he of God’s making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
Nay, he hath but a little beard.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both in an instant.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true maid.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
I’ faith, coz, ’tis he.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Orlando?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
Orlando.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet and hose? What did he when thou saw’st him? What said he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him again? Answer me in one word.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first. ’Tis a word too great for any mouth of this age’s size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
It may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
Give me audience, good madam.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Proceed.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
There lay he, stretched along like a wounded knight.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
Cry “holla!” to thy tongue, I prithee. It curvets unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
O, ominous! He comes to kill my heart.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
I would sing my song without a burden. Thou bring’st me out of tune.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak. Sweet, say on.
[Enter Orlando and <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>.]
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">CELIA<chara>.
You bring me out. Soft, comes he not here?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
’Tis he! Slink by, and note him.
[Rosalind and <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara> step aside.]
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I thank you for your company but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
God be wi’ you, let’s meet as little as we can.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I do desire we may be better strangers.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I pray you, mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading them ill-favouredly.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Rosalind is your love’s name?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Yes, just.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I do not like her name.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
What stature is she of?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Just as high as my heart.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths’ wives, and conned them out of rings?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
You have a nimble wit. I think ’twas made of Atalanta’s heels. Will you sit down with me? And we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
’Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
He is drowned in the brook. Look but in, and you shall see him.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
There I shall see mine own figure.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I’ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior Love.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I am glad of your departure. Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.
[Exit <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>.—<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara> and Rosalind come forward.]
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him.
Do you hear, forester?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Very well. What would you?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I pray you, what is’t o’clock?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
You should ask me what time o’ day. There’s no clock in the forest.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
And why not the swift foot of time? Had not that been as proper?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized. If the interim be but a se’nnight, time’s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Who ambles time withal?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These time ambles withal.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Who doth he gallop withal?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Who stays it still withal?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Where dwell you, pretty youth?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
With this shepherdess, my sister, here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Are you native of this place?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I have been told so of many. But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
There were none principal. They were all like one another as halfpence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I prithee recount some of them.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
No. I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I am he that is so love-shaked. I pray you tell me your remedy.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
What were his marks?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue. Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man. You are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Did you ever cure any so?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress, and I set him every day to woo me; at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness, which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in ’t.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I would not be cured, youth.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
With all my heart, good youth.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female" dress= "male">ROSALIND<chara>.
Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Another part of the Forest
[Enter <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara> and <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>; <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara> at a distance observing them.]
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Come apace, good <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>. I will fetch up your goats, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>. And how, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>? Am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
Your features, Lord warrant us! What features?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
[Aside.] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatched house!
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
When a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a man’s good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
I do not know what “poetical” is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said, as lovers, they do feign.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
Would you not have me honest?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
[Aside.] A material fool!
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee. And to that end I have been with <chara name= "Sir Oliver Martext" gender= "male">Sir Oliver Martext</chara>, the vicar of the next village, who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
[Aside.] I would fain see this meeting.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
Well, the gods give us joy!
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt, for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, “Many a man knows no end of his goods.” Right. Many a man has good horns and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore blessed? No. As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor. And by how much defence is better than no skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want.

Here comes <chara name= "Sir Oliver Martext" gender= "male">Sir Oliver</chara>. <chara name= "Sir Oliver Martext" gender= "male">Sir Oliver Martext</chara>, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
MARTEXT.
Is there none here to give the woman?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
I will not take her on gift of any man.
MARTEXT.
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
[Coming forward.] Proceed, proceed. I’ll give her.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Good even, good Master What-ye-call’t, how do you, sir? You are very well met. God ’ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be covered.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Will you be married, motley?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is. This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber, warp, warp.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
[Aside.] I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another, for he is not like to marry me well, and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Come, sweet <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>. We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not
             O sweet Oliver,
             O brave Oliver,
         Leave me not behind thee.
But
             Wind away,—
             Begone, I say,
         I will not to wedding with thee.
[Exeunt <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara> and <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>.]
MARTEXT.
’Tis no matter. Ne’er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling.
[Exit.]
SCENE IV. Another part of the Forest. Before a Cottage
[Enter Rosalind and <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>.]
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Never talk to me, I will weep.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
But have I not cause to weep?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his kisses are Judas’s own children.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I’ faith, his hair is of a good colour.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
An excellent colour. Your chestnut was ever the only colour.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of chastity is in them.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Do you think so?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Yes. I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Not true in love?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
You have heard him swear downright he was.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
“Was” is not “is”. Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him. He asked me of what parentage I was. I told him, of as good as he, so he laughed and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
O, that’s a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puny tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose. But all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who comes here?
[Enter <chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">Corin</chara>.]
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
After the shepherd that complained of love,
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
That was his mistress.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Well, and what of him?
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
If you will see a pageant truly played
Between the pale complexion of true love
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,
If you will mark it.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
O, come, let us remove.
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE V. Another part of the Forest
Enter <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara> and <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Sweet <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>, do not scorn me, do not, <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.
Say that you love me not, but say not so
In bitterness. The common executioner,
Whose heart th’ accustomed sight of death makes hard,
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
[Enter Rosalind, <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara> and <chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">Corin</chara>, at a distance.]
I would not be thy executioner;
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye.
’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable
That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,
The cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes
That can do hurt.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
O dear <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>,
If ever—as that ever may be near—
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
Then shall you know the wounds invisible
That love’s keen arrows make.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
But till that time
Come not thou near me. And when that time comes,
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not,
As till that time I shall not pity thee.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
[Advancing.] And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
That you insult, exult, and all at once,
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty—
As, by my faith, I see no more in you
Than without candle may go dark to bed—
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Of nature’s sale-work. ’Od’s my little life,
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.
’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
That can entame my spirits to your worship.
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
You are a thousand times a properer man
Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you
That makes the world full of ill-favoured children.
’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,
And out of you she sees herself more proper
Than any of her lineaments can show her.
But, mistress, know yourself; down on your knees,
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love.
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together!
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
He’s fall’n in love with your foulness, and she’ll fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I’ll sauce her with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
For no ill will I bear you.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I pray you do not fall in love with me,
For I am falser than vows made in wine.
Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
’Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
And be not proud. Though all the world could see,
None could be so abused in sight as he.
Come, to our flock.
[Exeunt Rosalind, <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara> and <chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">Corin</chara>.]
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
“Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Sweet <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>—
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Ha, what sayst thou, <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>?
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Sweet <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>, pity me.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
By giving love your sorrow and my grief
Were both extermined.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Thou hast my love. Is not that neighbourly?
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
I would have you.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Why, that were covetousness.
<chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>, the time was that I hated thee;
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too.
But do not look for further recompense
Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
So holy and so perfect is my love,
And I in such a poverty of grace,
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
To glean the broken ears after the man
That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then
A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Not very well, but I have met him oft,
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
That the old carlot once was master of.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Think not I love him, though I ask for him.
’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well.
But what care I for words? Yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—
But sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him.
He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall;
His leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well.
There was a pretty redness in his lip,
A little riper and more lusty red
Than that mixed in his cheek. ’Twas just the difference
Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women, <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>, had they marked him
In parcels as I did, would have gone near
To fall in love with him; but for my part
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
I have more cause to hate him than to love him.
For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,
And now I am remembered, scorned at me.
I marvel why I answered not again.
But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.
I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,
And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>?
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>, with all my heart.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
I’ll write it straight,
The matter’s in my head and in my heart.
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Go with me, <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.
[Exeunt.]
ACT IV

SCENE I. The Forest of Arden
Enter Rosalind, <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara> and <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Why then, ’tis good to be a post.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Yes, I have gained my experience.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad—and to travel for it too.
[Enter Orlando.]
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Nay, then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller. Look you lisp and wear strange suits; disable all the benefits of your own country; be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola.
[Exit <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>.]
Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Break an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped him o’ the shoulder, but I’ll warrant him heart-whole.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be wooed of a snail.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Of a snail?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head—a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny with him.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
What’s that?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Virtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
And I am your Rosalind.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I would kiss before I spoke.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
How if the kiss be denied?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
What, of my suit?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Then, in mine own person, I die.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and, being taken with the cramp, was drowned; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies. Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I will grant it.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Then love me, Rosalind.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
And wilt thou have me?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Ay, and twenty such.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
What sayest thou?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Are you not good?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I hope so.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Pray thee, marry us.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
I cannot say the words.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
You must begin “Will you, Orlando—”
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I will.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Ay, but when?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Why now, as fast as she can marry us.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I might ask you for your commission. But I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s thought runs before her actions.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
So do all thoughts. They are winged.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
For ever and a day.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Say “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou are inclined to sleep.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
But will my Rosalind do so?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
By my life, she will do as I do.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
O, but she is wise.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement. Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither wilt?”
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbour’s bed.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be with thee again.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o’clock is your hour?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind. So, adieu.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time try. Adieu.
[Exit Orlando.]
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate! We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
No, that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I’ll tell thee, <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Aliena<chara>, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
And I’ll sleep.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. Another part of the Forest
Enter <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara> and Lords, like foresters.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Which is he that killed the deer?
FIRST LORD.
Sir, it was I.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Let’s present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror, and it would do well to set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
SECOND LORD.
Yes, sir.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.
SONG
SECOND LORD.
[Sings.]
  What shall he have that killed the deer?
        His leather skin and horns to wear.
                  Then sing him home:
  [The rest shall bear this burden.]
            Take thou no scorn to wear the horn.
            It was a crest ere thou wast born.
                  Thy father’s father wore it
                  And thy father bore it.
            The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
            Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Another part of the Forest
Enter Rosalind and <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
How say you now? Is it not past two o’clock? And here much Orlando.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep.
Enter <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.
Look who comes here.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
My errand is to you, fair youth.
My gentle <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara> did bid me give you this.
[Giving a letter.]
I know not the contents, but, as I guess
By the stern brow and waspish action
Which she did use as she was writing of it,
It bears an angry tenor. Pardon me,
I am but as a guiltless messenger.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all!
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
Were man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will,
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt.
Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
This is a letter of your own device.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
No, I protest, I know not the contents.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara> did write it.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Come, come, you are a fool,
And turned into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand. She has a leathern hand,
A freestone-coloured hand. I verily did think
That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands.
She has a huswife’s hand—but that’s no matter.
I say she never did invent this letter;
This is a man’s invention, and his hand.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Sure, it is hers.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
Like Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
So please you, for I never heard it yet,
Yet heard too much of <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>’s cruelty.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
She <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>s me. Mark how the tyrant writes.
[Reads.]
            Art thou god to shepherd turned,
            That a maiden’s heart hath burned?
Can a woman rail thus?
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Call you this railing?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
            Why, thy godhead laid apart,
            Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?
Did you ever hear such railing?
            Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
            That could do no vengeance to me.
Meaning me a beast.
            If the scorn of your bright eyne
            Have power to raise such love in mine,
            Alack, in me what strange effect
            Would they work in mild aspect?
            Whiles you chid me, I did love,
            How then might your prayers move?
            He that brings this love to thee
            Little knows this love in me;
            And by him seal up thy mind,
            Whether that thy youth and kind
            Will the faithful offer take
            Of me, and all that I can make,
            Or else by him my love deny,
            And then I’ll study how to die.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Call you this chiding?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Alas, poor shepherd.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity.—Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee? Not to be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word, for here comes more company.
[Exit <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.]
Enter <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver</chara>.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you, if you know,
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom;
The rank of osiers, by the murmuring stream,
Left on your right hand, brings you to the place.
But at this hour the house doth keep itself.
There’s none within.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
Then should I know you by description,
Such garments, and such years. “The boy is fair,
Of female favour, and bestows himself
Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
And browner than her brother.” Are not you
The owner of the house I did inquire for?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Orlando doth commend him to you both,
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I am. What must we understand by this?
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Some of my shame, if you will know of me
What man I am, and how, and why, and where
This handkerchief was stained.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
I pray you tell it.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
When last the young Orlando parted from you,
He left a promise to return again
Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
Lo, what befell. He threw his eye aside,
And mark what object did present itself.
Under an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age
And high top bald with dry antiquity,
A wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,
Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached
The opening of his mouth. But suddenly,
Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself
And with indented glides did slip away
Into a bush; under which bush’s shade
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch
When that the sleeping man should stir. For ’tis
The royal disposition of that beast
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
This seen, Orlando did approach the man
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,
And he did render him the most unnatural
That lived amongst men.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
And well he might so do,
For well I know he was unnatural.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
Made him give battle to the lioness,
Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
From miserable slumber I awaked.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Are you his brother?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Was it you he rescued?
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
’Twas I; but ’tis not I. I do not shame
To tell you what I was, since my conversion
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
But, for the bloody napkin?
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
By and by.
When from the first to last betwixt us two
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed—
As how I came into that desert place—
In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
Committing me unto my brother’s love,
Who led me instantly unto his cave,
There stripped himself, and here upon his arm
The lioness had torn some flesh away,
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.
Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound,
And after some small space, being strong at heart,
He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
To tell this story, that you might excuse
His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
Dyed in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
[Rosalind faints.]
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede!
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
There is more in it. Cousin—Ganymede!
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Look, he recovers.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I would I were at home.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
We’ll lead you thither.
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Be of good cheer, youth. You a man? You lack a man’s heart.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
This was not counterfeit. There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Counterfeit, I assure you.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
So I do. But, i’ faith, I should have been a woman by right.
<chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">CELIA<chara>.
Come, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
That will I, for I must bear answer back
How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I shall devise something. But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?
[Exeunt.]
ACT V

SCENE I. The Forest of Arden
Enter <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara> and <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
We shall find a time, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>; patience, gentle <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
A most wicked <chara name= "Sir Oliver Martext" gender= "male">Sir Oliver</chara>, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>, a most vile Martext. But <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
Ay, I know who ’tis. He hath no interest in me in the world.
Enter <chara name= "William" gender= "male">William</chara>.
Here comes the man you mean.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth, we that have good wits have much to answer for. We shall be flouting; we cannot hold.
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
Good ev’n, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
God ye good ev’n, <chara name= "William" gender= "male">William</chara>.
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
And good ev’n to you, sir.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Good ev’n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head. Nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
Five-and-twenty, sir.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
A ripe age. Is thy name <chara name= "William" gender= "male">William</chara>?
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">William</chara>, sir.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
A fair name. Wast born i’ th’ forest here?
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
Ay, sir, I thank God.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
“Thank God.” A good answer. Art rich?
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
Faith, sir, so-so.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
“So-so” is good, very good, very excellent good. And yet it is not, it is but so-so. Art thou wise?
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Why, thou sayst well. I do now remember a saying: “The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.” The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid?
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
I do, sir.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
No, sir.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Then learn this of me: to have is to have. For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out of cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other. For all your writers do consent that ipse is “he.” Now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
Which he, sir?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is in the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel. I will bandy with thee in faction; will o’errun thee with policy. I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways! Therefore tremble and depart.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
Do, good <chara name= "William" gender= "male">William</chara>.
<chara name= "William" gender= "male">WILLIAM</chara>.
God rest you merry, sir.
[Exit.]
Enter <chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">Corin</chara>.
<chara name= "Corin" gender= "male">CORIN</chara>.
Our master and mistress seek you. Come away, away.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Trip, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>, trip, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>! I attend, I attend.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE II. Another part of the Forest
Enter Orlando and <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver</chara>.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Is’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her? That but seeing, you should love her? And loving woo? And wooing, she should grant? And will you persever to enjoy her?
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden consenting. But say with me, I love <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Aliena<chara>; say with her that she loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
Enter Rosalind.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
You have my consent. Let your wedding be tomorrow. Thither will I invite the Duke and all’s contented followers. Go you and prepare <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Aliena<chara>; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
God save you, brother.
<chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">OLIVER</chara>.
And you, fair sister.
[Exit.]
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
O my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf!
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
It is my arm.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkercher?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Ay, and greater wonders than that.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
O, I know where you are. Nay, ’tis true. There was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of “I came, saw and overcame.” For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked; no sooner looked but they loved; no sooner loved but they sighed; no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy; and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial. But O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes! By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I can live no longer by thinking.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then—for now I speak to some purpose—that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are. Neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female" dress="female">Aliena<chara> shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Speak’st thou in sober meanings?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
By my life, I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your friends; for if you will be married tomorrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.
Enter <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara> and <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.
Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
To show the letter that I writ to you.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I care not if I have; it is my study
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.
Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
It is to be all made of sighs and tears,
And so am I for <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
And I for Ganymede.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
And I for Rosalind.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
And I for no woman.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
It is to be all made of faith and service,
And so am I for <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
And I for Ganymede.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
And I for Rosalind.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
And I for no woman.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
It is to be all made of fantasy,
All made of passion, and all made of wishes,
All adoration, duty, and observance,
All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,
All purity, all trial, all observance,
And so am I for <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
And so am I for Ganymede.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
And so am I for Rosalind.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
And so am I for no woman.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
[To Rosalind.] If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
[To <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.] If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Why do you speak too, “Why blame you me to love you?”
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Pray you, no more of this, ’tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon.
[to <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.] I will help you if I can.
[to <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.] I would love you if I could.—Tomorrow meet me all together.
[to <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.] I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I’ll be married tomorrow.
[to Orlando.] I will satisfy you if ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married tomorrow.
[to <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.] I will content you, if what pleases you contents you, and you shall be married tomorrow.
[to Orlando.] As you love Rosalind, meet.
[to <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.] As you love <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>, meet.—And as I love no woman, I’ll meet. So fare you well. I have left you commands.
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
I’ll not fail, if I live.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
Nor I.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
Nor I.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE III. Another part of the Forest
Enter <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara> and <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Tomorrow is the joyful day, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>, tomorrow will we be married.
<chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">AUDREY</chara>.
I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.
Enter two Pages.
Here come two of the banished Duke’s pages.
FIRST PAGE.
Well met, honest gentleman.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
SECOND PAGE.
We are for you, sit i’ th’ middle.
FIRST PAGE.
Shall we clap into’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?
SECOND PAGE.
I’faith, i’faith, and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horse.
                        SONG
PAGES.
[Sing.]
    It was a lover and his lass,
        With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    That o’er the green cornfield did pass
        In the spring-time, the only pretty ring time,
        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
    Sweet lovers love the spring.

    Between the acres of the rye,
        With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    These pretty country folks would lie,
        In the spring-time, the only pretty ring time,
        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
    Sweet lovers love the spring.

    This carol they began that hour,
        With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    How that a life was but a flower,
        In the spring-time, the only pretty ring time,
        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
    Sweet lovers love the spring.

    And therefore take the present time,
        With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    For love is crowned with the prime,
        In the spring-time, the only pretty ring time,
        When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
    Sweet lovers love the spring.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
FIRST PAGE.
You are deceived, sir, we kept time, we lost not our time.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
By my troth, yes. I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. God be wi’ you, and God mend your voices. Come, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>.
[Exeunt.]
SCENE IV. Another part of the Forest
Enter <chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">Duke Senior</chara>, <chara name= "Amiens" gender= "male">Amiens</chara>, <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>, Orlando, <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver</chara> and <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
Can do all this that he hath promised?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not,
As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
Enter Rosalind, <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara> and <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
Patience once more whiles our compact is urged.
[To the Duke.] You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
You will bestow her on Orlando here?
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
[To Orlando.] And you say you will have her when I bring her?
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
[To <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.] You say you’ll marry me if I be willing?
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
That will I, should I die the hour after.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
But if you do refuse to marry me,
You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
So is the bargain.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
[To <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.] You say that you’ll have <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara> if she will?
<chara name="Silvius" gender="male">SILVIUS</chara>.
Though to have her and death were both one thing.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
I have promised to make all this matter even.
Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter,
You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter.
Keep your word, <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>, that you’ll marry me,
Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.
Keep your word, <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>, that you’ll marry her
If she refuse me. And from hence I go
To make these doubts all even.
[Exeunt Rosalind and <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>.]
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
I do remember in this shepherd boy
Some lively touches of my daughter’s favour.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born
And hath been tutored in the rudiments
Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
Whom he reports to be a great magician,
Obscured in the circle of this forest.
Enter <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara> and <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Salutation and greeting to you all.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
And how was that ta’en up?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
How seventh cause?—Good my lord, like this fellow?
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
I like him very well.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
God ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
But, for the seventh cause. How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
Upon a lie seven times removed—bear your body more seeming, <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara>—as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is called the “retort courteous”. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is called the “quip modest”. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgement. This is called the “reply churlish”. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called the “reproof valiant”. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is called the “countercheck quarrelsome”, and so, to the “lie circumstantial”, and the “lie direct”.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
I durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the lie direct; and so we measured swords and parted.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
<chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">TOUCHSTONE</chara>.
O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees: the first, the retort courteous; the second, the quip modest; the third, the reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant; the fifth, the countercheck quarrelsome; the sixth, the lie with circumstance; the seventh, the lie direct. All these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an “if”. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an “if”, as, “if you said so, then I said so;” and they shook hands, and swore brothers. Your “if” is the only peacemaker; much virtue in “if.”
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at anything, and yet a fool.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
Enter <chara name= "Hymen" gender= "male">Hymen</chara>, Rosalind in woman’s clothes, and <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara>. Still music.
<chara name= "Hymen" gender= "male">HYMEN</chara>.
    Then is there mirth in heaven
    When earthly things made even
        Atone together.
    Good Duke, receive thy daughter.
    <chara name= "Hymen" gender= "male">Hymen</chara> from heaven brought her,
        Yea, brought her hither,
    That thou mightst join her hand with his,
    Whose heart within his bosom is.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
[To <chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">Duke Senior</chara>.] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
[To Orlando.] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
<chara name= "Orlando" gender= "male">ORLANDO</chara>.
If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
If sight and shape be true,
Why then, my love adieu.
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
[To <chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">Duke Senior</chara>.] I’ll have no father, if you be not he.
[To Orlando.] I’ll have no husband, if you be not he.
[To <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.] Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not she.
<chara name= "Hymen" gender= "male">HYMEN</chara>.
    Peace, ho! I bar confusion.
    ’Tis I must make conclusion
        Of these most strange events.
    Here’s eight that must take hands
    To join in <chara name= "Hymen" gender= "male">Hymen</chara>’s bands,
        If truth holds true contents.
[To Orlando and Rosalind.] You and you no cross shall part.
[To <chara name= "Celia" gender= "female">Celia<chara> and <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver</chara>.] You and you are heart in heart.
[To <chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">Phoebe</chara>.] You to his love must accord
Or have a woman to your lord.
[To <chara name= "Audrey" gender= "female">Audrey</chara> and <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>.] You and you are sure together
As the winter to foul weather.
Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing,
Feed yourselves with questioning,
That reason wonder may diminish
How thus we met, and these things finish.
                        SONG
      Wedding is great Juno’s crown,
            O blessed bond of board and bed.
      ’Tis <chara name= "Hymen" gender= "male">Hymen</chara> peoples every town,
            High wedlock then be honoured.
      Honour, high honour, and renown
      To <chara name= "Hymen" gender= "male">Hymen</chara>, god of every town.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me
Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
<chara name= "Phoebe" gender= "female">PHOEBE</chara>.
[To <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.] I will not eat my word, now thou art mine,
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
Enter <chara name= "Jaques de Boys" gender= "male">Jaques de Boys</chara>.
<chara name= "Jaques de Boys" gender= "male">JAQUES DE BOYS</chara>.
Let me have audience for a word or two.
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
<chara name= "Duke Frederick" gender= "male">Duke Frederick</chara>, hearing how that every day
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot
In his own conduct, purposely to take
His brother here and put him to the sword;
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
Where, meeting with an old religious man,
After some question with him, was converted
Both from his enterprise and from the world,
His crown bequeathing to his banished brother,
And all their lands restored to them again
That were with him exiled. This to be true
I do engage my life.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Welcome, young man.
Thou offer’st fairly to thy brother’s wedding:
To one his lands withheld, and to the other
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
First, in this forest let us do those ends
That here were well begun and well begot;
And after, every of this happy number
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
According to the measure of their states.
Meantime, forget this new-fall’n dignity,
And fall into our rustic revelry.
Play, music! And you brides and bridegrooms all,
With measure heaped in joy to th’ measures fall.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
The Duke hath put on a religious life
And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
<chara name= "Jaques de Boys" gender= "male">JAQUES DE BOYS</chara>.
He hath.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
To him will I. Out of these convertites
There is much matter to be heard and learned.
[To <chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">Duke Senior</chara>.] You to your former honour I bequeath;
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
[To Orlando.] You to a love that your true faith doth merit.
[To <chara name= "Oliver" gender= "male">Oliver</chara>.] You to your land, and love, and great allies.
[To <chara name= "Silvius" gender= "male">Silvius</chara>.] You to a long and well-deserved bed.
[To <chara name= "Touchstone" gender= "male">Touchstone</chara>.] And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage
Is but for two months victualled.—So to your pleasures,
I am for other than for dancing measures.
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Stay, <chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">Jaques</chara>, stay.
<chara name= "Jaques" gender= "male">JAQUES</chara>.
To see no pastime, I. What you would have
I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.
[Exit.]
<chara name= "Duke Senior" gender= "male">DUKE SENIOR</chara>.
Proceed, proceed! We will begin these rites,
As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.
[Dance. Exeunt all but Rosalind.]
EPILOGUE
<chara name= "Rosalind" gender= "female">ROSALIND<chara>.
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue, but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes, and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnished like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I’ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you. And I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women—as I perceive by your simpering, none of you hates them—that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me, complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not. And I am sure as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
[Exit.]
