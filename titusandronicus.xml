    <title>ACT 1. SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol</title>

<stage> Flourish. Enter the TRIBUNES and SENATORS aloft; and 
     then enter below SATURNINUS and his followers at one door, and BASSIANUS and his
  followers at the other, with drums and trumpets</stage>
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
    Defend the justice of my cause with arms;
    And, countrymen, my loving followers,
    Plead my successive title with your swords.
    I am his first born son that was the last
    That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
    Then let my father's <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>s live in me,
    Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> Romans, friends, followers, favourers of my right,
    If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
    Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
    Keep then this passage to the Capitol;
    And suffer not dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> to approach
    The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
    To justice, continence, and nobility;
    But let desert in pure election shine;
    And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
<stage>Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS aloft, with the crown</stage>
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> <power type="patriarch">Princes</power>, that strive by factions and by friends
    Ambitiously for rule and empery,
    Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
    A special party, have by common voice
    In election for the Roman empery
    Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
    For many good and great deserts to Rome.
    A nobler man, a braver warrior,
    Lives not this day within the city walls.
    He by the Senate is accited home,
    From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,
    That with his sons, a terror to our foes,
    Hath yok'd a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
    Ten years are spent since first he undertook
    This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms
    Our enemies' pride; five times he hath return'd
    Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
    In coffins from the field; and at this day
    To the monument of that Andronici
    Done sacrifice of expiation,
    And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths.
    And now at last, laden with <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>'s spoils,
    Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
    Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
    Let us entreat, by <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> of his name
    Whom worthily you would have now succeed,
    And in the Capitol and Senate's right,
    Whom you pretend to <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> and adore,
    That you withdraw you and abate your strength,
    Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should,
    Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts.
  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy
    In thy uprightness and integrity,
    And so I love and <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> thee and thine,
    Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
    And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
    Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
    That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
    And to my fortunes and the people's favour
    Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
                                <stage>Exeunt the soldiers of BASSIANUS</stage>
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
    I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
    And to the love and favour of my country
    Commit myself, my person, and the cause.
                               <stage>Exeunt the soldiers of SATURNINUS</stage>
    Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
    As I am confident and kind to thee.
    Open the gates and let me in.
  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
                    <stage>[Flourish. They go up into the Senate House]
             Enter a CAPTAIN</stage>
  <speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker> Romans, make way. The good Andronicus,
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
    Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword
    And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.
<stage>Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter MARTIUS and MUTIUS, two of TITUS' sons; and then two men bearing a coffin covered with <color is="black" context="death">black</color>; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS, two other sons; then TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA the <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> of Goths, with her three sons, ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, with AARON the Moor, and others, as many as can be. Then set down the coffin and TITUS speaks</stage>  
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
    Lo, as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught
    Returns with precious lading to the bay
    From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
    Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
    To re-salute his country with his <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>,
    <depiction role="weakness" gender="">Tears</depiction> of true joy for his return to Rome.
    Thou great defender of this Capitol,
    Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
    Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
    Half of the number that King Priam had,
    Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
    These that survive let Rome reward with love;
    These that I bring unto their latest home,
    With burial amongst their ancestors.
    Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
    Titus, unkind, and careless of thine own,
    Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
    To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
    Make way to lay them by their brethren.
                                            <stage>[They open the tomb]</stage>
    There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
    And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars.
    O sacred receptacle of my joys,
    Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
    How many sons hast thou of mine in store
    That thou wilt never render to me more!
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
    That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
    Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
    Before this earthy prison of their bones,
    That so the shadows be not unappeas'd,
    Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> I give him you- the noblest that survives,
    The eldest son of this distressed <power type="matriarch">queen</power>.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Stay, Roman brethen! Gracious conqueror,
    Victorious Titus, rue the <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> I shed,
    A mother's <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> in passion for her son;
    And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
    O, think my son to be as dear to me!
    Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
    To beautify thy triumphs, and return
    Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
    But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
    For valiant doings in their country's cause?
    O, if to fight for king and commonweal
    Were piety in thine, it is in these.
    Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with <color is="red" context="death">blood.</color>
    Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
    Draw near them then in being merciful.
    Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.
    Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
    These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld
    Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain
    Religiously they ask a sacrifice.
    To this your son is mark'd, and die he must
    T' appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Away with him, and make a fire straight;
    And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
    Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd.
                                <stage>Exeunt TITUS' SONS, with ALARBUS</stage>
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> O cruel, irreligious piety!
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Was never Scythia half so barbarous!
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
    Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
    To tremble under Titus' threat'ning look.
    Then, madam, stand resolv'd, but hope withal
    The self-same gods that arm'd the <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> of Troy
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
    May favour Tamora, the <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> of Goths-
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was <power type="matriarch">queen</power>-
    To quit the <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color> wrongs upon her foes.
                 <stage>Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and
         MUTIUS, the sons of ANDRONICUS, with their swords <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color></stage>
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> See, <power type="patriarch">lord</power> and father, how we have perform'd
    Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
    And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
    Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.
    Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,
    And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Let it be so, and let Andronicus
    Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
                 <stage>[Sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb]</stage>
    In peace and <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> rest you here, my sons;
    Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
    Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
    Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
    Here grow no damned grudges, here are no storms,
    No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.
    In peace and <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> rest you here, my sons!
<stage>Enter LAVINIA</stage>
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> In peace and <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> live <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Titus long;
    My noble <power type="patriarch">lord</power> and father, live in fame!
    Lo, at this tomb my tributary <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>
    I render for my brethren's obsequies;
    And at thy feet I kneel, with <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> of joy
    Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.
    O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
    Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserv'd
    The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
    Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
    And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
                 <stage>Enter, above, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and TRIBUNES;
                 re-enter SATURNINUS, BASSIANUS, and attendants
          <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Long live <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Titus, my beloved brother,</stage>
    Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Thanks, gentle Tribune, noble brother Marcus.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
    You that survive and you that sleep in fame.
    Fair <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, your fortunes are alike in all
    That in your country's service drew your swords;
    But safer triumph is this funeral pomp
    That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness
    And triumphs over chance in <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>'s bed.
    Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
    Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
    Send thee by me, their Tribune and their trust,
    This palliament of <color is="white" context="pure">white and spotless</color> hue;
    And name thee in election for the empire
    With these our late-deceased Emperor's sons:
    Be candidatus then, and put it on,
    And help to set a head on headless Rome.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> A better head her glorious body fits
    Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.
    What, should I don this robe and trouble you?
    Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
    To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
    And set abroach new business for you all?
    Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
    And led my country's strength successfully,
    And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
    Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
    In right and service of their noble country.
    Give me a staff of <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> for mine age,
    But not a sceptre to control the world.
    Upright he held it, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, that held it last.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Proud and ambitious Tribune, canst thou tell?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Patience, <power type="patriarch">Prince</power> Saturninus.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Romans, do me right.
    Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not
    Till Saturninus be Rome's Emperor.
    Andronicus, would thou were shipp'd to hell
    Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
    That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Content thee, <power type="patriarch">Prince</power>; I will restore to thee
    The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
    But <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> thee, and will do till I die.
    My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
    I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
    Of noble minds is <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>able meed.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> People of Rome, and people's Tribunes here,
    I ask your voices and your suffrages:
    Will ye bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
  <speaker>TRIBUNES.</speaker> To gratify the good Andronicus,
    And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
    The people will accept whom he admits.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Tribunes, I thank you; and this suit I make,
    That you create our Emperor's eldest son,
    <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
    Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
    And ripen justice in this commonweal.
    Then, if you will elect by my advice,
    Crown him, and say 'Long live our Emperor!'
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> With voices and applause of every sort,
    Patricians and plebeians, we create
    <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Saturninus Rome's great Emperor;
    And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
                           <stage>[A long flourish till they come down]</stage>
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Titus Andronicus, for thy favours done
    To us in our election this day
    I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
    And will with deeds requite thy gentleness;
    And for an onset, Titus, to advance
    Thy name and <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>able family,
    Lavinia will I make my empress,
    Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
    And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
    Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> It doth, my worthy <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, and in this match
    I hold me highly <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ed of your Grace,
    And here in sight of Rome, to Saturnine,
    King and commander of our commonweal,
    The wide world's Emperor, do I consecrate
    My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners,
    Presents well worthy Rome's imperious <power type="patriarch">lord</power>;
    Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
    Mine <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>'s ensigns humbled at thy feet.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.
    How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
    Rome shall record; and when I do forget
    The least of these unspeakable deserts,
    Romans, forget your fealty to me.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker><stage> [To TAMORA]</stage> Now, madam, are you prisoner to an
emperor;
    To him that for your <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> and your state
    Will use you nobly and your followers.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker><stage> [Aside]</stage> A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
    That I would choose, were I to choose anew.-
    Clear up, fair <power type="matriarch">Queen</power>, that cloudy countenance;
    Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
    Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome-
    <power type="patriarch">Prince</power>ly shall be thy usage every way.
    Rest on my word, and let not discontent
    Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you
    Can make you greater than the <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> of Goths.
    Lavinia, you are not displeas'd with this?
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> Not I, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, sith true nobility
    Warrants these words in <power type="patriarch">prince</power>ly courtesy.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go.
    Ransomless here we set our prisoners free.
    Proclaim our <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>s, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, with trump and drum.

  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> Ay, noble Titus, and resolv'd withal
    To do myself this reason and this right.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Suum cuique is our Roman justice:
    This <power type="patriarch">prince</power> in justice seizeth but his own.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> And that he will and shall, if Lucius live.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> <depiction role="villain" gender="">Traitors</depiction>, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard?
    Treason, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>- Lavinia is surpris'd!

  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> My <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, you are unjust, and more than so:

    That is another's lawful promis'd love. Exit
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> No, Titus, no; the Emperor needs her not,
    Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock.
    I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once;
    Thee never, nor thy <depiction role="villain" gender="">traitorous</depiction> haughty sons,
    Confederates all thus to dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> me.
    Was there none else in Rome to make a stale
    But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
    Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
    That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> O monstrous! What reproachful words are these?
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
    To him that flourish'd for her with his sword.
    A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
    One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
    To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> These words are razors to my wounded heart.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> And therefore, lovely Tamora, <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> of Goths,
    That, like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs,
    Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
    If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice,
    Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride
    And will create thee Empress of Rome.
    Speak, <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
    And here I swear by all the Roman gods-
    Sith priest and holy water are so near,
    And tapers burn so bright, and everything
    In readiness for Hymenaeus stand-
    I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
    Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
    I lead espous'd my bride along with me.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear,
    If Saturnine advance the <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> of Goths,
    She will a handmaid be to his desires,
    A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Ascend, fair <power type="matriarch">Queen</power>, Pantheon. <power type="patriarch">Lords</power>, accompany
    Your noble Emperor and his lovely bride,
    Sent by the heavens for <power type="patriarch">Prince</power> Saturnine,
    Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered;
    There shall we consummate our spousal rites.

  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
  TITUS, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
    Dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ed thus, and challenged of wrongs?
                      <stage>Re-enter MARCUS,
        and TITUS' SONS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS</stage>
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
    In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> No, foolish Tribune, no; no son of mine-
    Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
    That hath dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ed all our family;
    Unworthy brother and unworthy sons!
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> But let us give him burial, as becomes;
    Give Mutius burial with our bretheren.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> <depiction role="villain" gender="">Traitors</depiction>, away! He rests not in this tomb.
    This monument five hundred years hath stood,
    Which I have sumptuously re-edified;
    Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
    Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls.
    Bury him where you can, he comes not here.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> My <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, this is impiety in you.
    My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him;
    He must be buried with his bretheren.
  <speaker>QUINTUS &amp; MARTIUS.</speaker> And shall, or him we will accompany.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> 'And shall!' What villain was it spake that word?
  <speaker>QUINTUS.</speaker> He that would vouch it in any place but here.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> What, would you bury him in my despite?
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
    To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
    And with these boys mine <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> thou hast wounded.
    My foes I do repute you every one;
    So trouble me no more, but get you gone.
  <speaker>MARTIUS.</speaker> He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
  <speaker>QUINTUS.</speaker> Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.

  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Brother, for in that name doth nature plead-

  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Renowned Titus, more than half my soul-

  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
    His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
    That died in <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> and Lavinia's cause.
    Thou art a Roman- be not barbarous.
    The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax,
    That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
    Did graciously plead for his funerals.
    Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy,

    How comes it that the subtle <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> of Goths

    Is she not, then, beholding to the man

  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> And you of yours, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>! I say no more,

  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> <depiction role="villain" gender="">Traitor</depiction>, if Rome have law or we have power,

  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> Rape, call you it, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, to seize my own,

  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> My <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, what I have done, as best I may,
    Answer I must, and shall do with my life.
    Only thus much I give your Grace to know:
    By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
    This noble gentleman, <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Titus here,
    Is in opinion and in <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> wrong'd,
    That, in the rescue of Lavinia,
    With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
    In zeal to you, and highly mov'd to wrath
    To be controll'd in that he frankly gave.
    Receive him then to favour, Saturnine,
    That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
    A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> <power type="patriarch">Prince</power> Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds.
    'Tis thou and those that have dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ed me.
    Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
    How I have lov'd and <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ed Saturnine!
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> My worthy <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, if ever Tamora
    Were gracious in those <power type="patriarch">prince</power>ly eyes of thine,
    Then hear me speak indifferently for all;
    And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> What, madam! be dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ed openly,
    And basely put it up without revenge?
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Not so, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>; the gods of Rome forfend
    I should be author to dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> you!
    But on mine <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> dare I undertake
    For good <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Titus' innocence in all,
    Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.
    Then at my suit look graciously on him;
    Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
    Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
   <stage> [Aside to SATURNINUS]</stage> My <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, be rul'd by me,

    Dissemble all your griefs and discontents.
    You are but newly planted in your throne;

    Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
    Yield at entreats, and then let me alone:
    I'll find a day to massacre them all,
    And raze their faction and their family,
    The cruel father and his <depiction role="villain" gender="">traitorous</depiction> sons,
    To whom I sued for my dear son's life;
    And make them know what 'tis to let a <power type="matriarch">queen</power>
    Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.-
    Come, come, sweet Emperor; come, Andronicus.
    Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
    That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Rise, Titus, rise; my Empress hath prevail'd.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> I thank your Majesty and her, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>;
    These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
    A Roman now adopted happily,

    This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
    And let it be mine <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>, good my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>,
    That I have reconcil'd your friends and you.
    For you, <power type="patriarch">Prince</power> Bassianus, I have pass'd
    My word and promise to the Emperor
    That you will be more mild and tractable.
    And fear not, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>- and you, Lavinia.
    By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
    You shall ask pardon of his Majesty.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> We do, and vow to heaven and to his Highness
    That what we did was mildly as we might,
    Tend'ring our sister's <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> and our own.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> That on mine <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> here do I protest.

  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends.

    And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
    I do remit these young men's heinous faults.
    Stand up.
    Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
    I found a friend; and sure as death I swore
    I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
    Come, if the Emperor's court can feast two brides,
    You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
    This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.

    <title>ACT II. SCENE I. Rome. Before the palace</title>

<stage>Enter AARON</stage>
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
    Safe out of Fortune's shot, and sits aloft,
    Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash,
    Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach.
    As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
    And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
    Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills,
    So Tamora.
    Upon her wit doth earthly <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> wait,
    And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
    Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
    To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
    And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
    Hast prisoner held, fett'red in amorous chains,
    And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
    Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
    Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
    I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold,
    To wait upon this new-made empress.
    To wait, said I? To wanton with this <power type="matriarch">queen</power>,
    This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
    This siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
    And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
    Hullo! what storm is this?
<stage>Enter CHIRON and DEMETRIUS, braving</stage>
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge
    And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,
    And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;
    And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
    'Tis not the difference of a year or two
    Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
    I am as able and as fit as thou
    To serve and to deserve my mistress' grace;
    And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
    And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker><stage> [Aside]</stage> Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the
    peace.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Why, boy, although our mother, unadvis'd,
    Gave you a dancing rapier by your side,
    Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?
    Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
    Till you know better how to handle it.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
    Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?<stage> [They draw]</stage>
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker><stage> [Coming forward]</stage> Why, how now, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>!
    So near the Emperor's palace dare ye draw
    And maintain such a quarrel openly?
    Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
    I would not for a million of gold
    The cause were known to them it most concerns;
    Nor would your noble mother for much more
    Be so dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ed in the court of Rome.
    For <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shame</depiction>, put up.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Not I, till I have sheath'd
    My rapier in his bosom, and withal
    Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
    That he hath breath'd in my dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> here.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> For that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd,
    Foul-spoken coward, that thund'rest with thy tongue,
    And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Away, I say!
    Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
    This pretty brabble will undo us all.
    Why, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, and think you not how dangerous
    It is to jet upon a <power type="patriarch">prince</power>'s right?
    What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
    Or Bassianus so degenerate,
    That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
    Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
    Young <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, beware; an should the Empress know
    This discord's ground, the music would not please.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
    I love Lavinia more than all the world.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
    Lavina is thine elder brother's hope.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Why, are ye mad, or know ye not in Rome
    How furious and impatient they be,
    And cannot brook competitors in love?
    I tell you, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, you do but plot your deaths
    By this device.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Aaron, a thousand deaths
    Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> To achieve her- how?
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Why mak'st thou it so strange?
    She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
    She is a woman, therefore may be won;
    She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov'd.
    What, man! more water glideth by the mill
    Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
    Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.
    Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother,
    Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker><stage> [Aside]</stage> Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Then why should he despair that knows to court it
    With words, fair looks, and liberality?
    What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
    And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so
    Would serve your turns.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Ay, so the turn were served.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Aaron, thou hast hit it.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Would you had hit it too!
    Then should not we be tir'd with this ado.
    Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
    To square for this? Would it offend you, then,
    That both should speed?
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Faith, not me.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Nor me, so I were one.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> For <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shame</depiction>, be friends, and join for that you jar.
    'Tis policy and stratagem must do
    That you affect; and so must you resolve
    That what you cannot as you would achieve,
    You must perforce accomplish as you may.
    Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
    Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
    A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
    Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
    My <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, a solemn hunting is in hand;
    There will the lovely Roman ladies troop;
    The forest walks are wide and spacious,
    And many unfrequented plots there are
    Fitted by kind for rape and villainy.
    Single you thither then this dainty doe,
    And strike her home by force if not by words.
    This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
    Come, come, our Empress, with her sacred wit
    To villainy and vengeance consecrate,
    Will we acquaint with all what we intend;
    And she shall file our engines with advice
    That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
    But to your wishes' height advance you both.
    The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
    The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears;
    The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.
    There speak and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;
    There serve your <depiction role="predator" gender="">lust</depiction>, shadowed from heaven's eye,
    And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.

    And never after to inherit it.
    Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
    Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
    Which, cunningly effected, will beget
    A very excellent piece of villainy.
    And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest

<stage>Enter TAMORA alone, to the Moor</stage>
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad
    When everything does make a gleeful boast?
    The birds chant melody on every bush;
    The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun;
    The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
    And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground;
    Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
    And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
    Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns,
    As if a double hunt were heard at once,
    Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
    And- after conflict such as was suppos'd
    The wand'ring <power type="patriarch">prince</power> and Dido once enjoyed,
    When with a happy storm they were surpris'd,
    And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave-
    We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
    Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber,
    Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
    Be unto us as is a nurse's song
    Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
    Saturn is dominator over mine.
    What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
    My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
    My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
    Even as an adder when she doth unroll
    To do some fatal execution?
    No, madam, these are no venereal signs.
    Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
    <color is="red" context="death">Blood </color>and revenge are hammering in my head.
    Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
    Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee-
    This is the day of doom for Bassianus;
    His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
    Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,
    And wash their <power gender="">hands</power>in Bassianus' <color is="red" context="death">blood.</color>
    Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee,
    And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll.
    Now question me no more; we are espied.
    Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
    Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
<stage>Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA</stage>
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> No more, great Empress: Bassianus comes.
    Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
    To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be. Exit
  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> Who have we here? Rome's royal Empress,
    Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
    Or is it Dian, habited like her,
    Who hath abandoned her holy groves
    To see the general hunting in this forest?
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Saucy controller of my private steps!
    Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had,
    Thy temples should be planted presently
    With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
    Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
    Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> Under your patience, gentle Empress,
    'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
    And to be doubted that your Moor and you
    Are singled forth to try thy experiments.
    Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
    'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> Believe me, <power type="matriarch">Queen</power>, your swarth Cimmerian
    Doth make your <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction> of his body's hue,
    Spotted, detested, and abominable.
    Why are you sequest'red from all your train,
    Dismounted from your <color is="white" context="pure">snow-white</color> goodly steed,
    And wand'red hither to an obscure plot,
    Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
    If foul desire had not conducted you?
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> And, being intercepted in your sport,
    Great reason that my noble <power type="patriarch">lord</power> be rated
    For sauciness. I pray you let us hence,
    And let her joy her raven-coloured love;
    This valley fits the purpose passing well.
  <speaker name="Bassianus" gender="man">BASSIANUS.</speaker> The King my brother shall have notice of this.
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> Ay, for these slips have made him noted long.
    Good king, to be so mightily abused!
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Why, I have patience to endure all this.
<stage>Enter CHIRON and DEMETRIUS</stage>
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
    Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan?
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
    These two have 'ticed me hither to this place.
    A barren detested vale you see it is:
    The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
    Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe;
    Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
    Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.
    And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
    They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
    A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
    Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
    Would make such fearful and confused cries
    As any mortal body hearing it
    Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly.
    No sooner had they told this hellish tale
    But straight they told me they would bind me here
    Unto the body of a dismal yew,
    And leave me to this miserable death.
    And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
    Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
    That ever ear did hear to such effect;
    And had you not by wondrous fortune come,
    This vengeance on me had they executed.
    Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
    Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> This is a witness that I am thy son.

  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> Ay, come, Semiramis- nay, barbarous Tamora,
    For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys,
    Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her;
    First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.
    This minion stood upon her chastity,
    Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
    And with that painted hope braves your mightiness;
    And shall she carry this unto her grave?
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
    Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
    And make his dead trunk pillow to our <depiction role="predator" gender="">lust</depiction>.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> But when ye have the honey we desire,
    Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
    Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
    That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> O Tamora! thou bearest a woman's face-
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> I will not hear her speak; away with her!
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> Sweet <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, entreat her hear me but a word.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
    To see her <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>; but be your heart to them
    As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
    O, do not learn her wrath- she taught it thee;
    The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble,
    Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
    Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
   <stage> [To CHIRON]</stage> Do thou entreat her show a woman's pity.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> 'Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark.
    Yet have I heard- O, could I find it now!-
    The lion, mov'd with pity, did endure
    To have his <power type="patriarch">prince</power>ly paws par'd all away.
    Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
    The whilst their own birds famish in their nests;
    O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
    Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> I know not what it means; away with her!
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> O, let me teach thee! For my father's sake,
    That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,
    Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
    Even for his sake am I pitiless.
    Remember, boys, I pour'd forth <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> in vain
    To save your brother from the sacrifice;
    But fierce Andronicus would not relent.
    Therefore away with her, and use her as you will;
    The worse to her the better lov'd of me.
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> O Tamora, be call'd a gentle <power type="matriarch">queen</power>,
    And with thine own <power gender="">hands</power>kill me in this place!
    For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
    Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> What beg'st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go.
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> 'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more,
    That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
    O, keep me from their worse than killing <depiction role="predator" gender="">lust</depiction>,
    And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
    Where never man's eye may behold my body;
    Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee;
    No, let them satisfy their <depiction role="predator" gender="">lust</depiction> on thee.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
  <speaker name="Lavinia" gender="woman">LAVINIA.</speaker> No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,
    The blot and enemy to our general name!
    Confusion fall-
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband.
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
                 <stage>DEMETRIUS throws the body
           of BASSIANUS into the pit; then exeunt
         DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging off LAVINIA</stage>
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Farewell, my sons; see that you make her sure.
    Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
    Till all the Andronici be made away.
    Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
    And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower. Exit
                  <stage>Re-enter AARON, with two

    Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers,
    Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed <color is="red" context="death">blood
</color>    As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
    A very fatal place it seems to me.
    Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
  <speaker>MARTIUS.</speaker> O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt
    That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker><stage> [Aside]</stage> Now will I fetch the King to find them here,
    That he thereby may have a likely guess

  <speaker>MARTIUS.</speaker> Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
    From this unhallow'd and <color is="red" context="death">blood-</color>stained hole?
  <speaker>QUINTUS.</speaker> I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
    A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
    My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
  <speaker>MARTIUS.</speaker> To prove thou hast a true divining heart,
    Aaron and thou look down into this den,
    And see a fearful sight of <color is="red" context="death">blood </color>and death.
  <speaker>QUINTUS.</speaker> Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
    Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
    The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
    O, tell me who it is, for ne'er till now
    Was I a child to fear I know not what.
  <speaker>MARTIUS.</speaker> <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Bassianus lies beray'd in <color is="red" context="death">blood,</color>
    All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
    In this detested, dark, <color is="red" context="death">blood-</color>drinking pit.
  <speaker>QUINTUS.</speaker> If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
  <speaker>MARTIUS.</speaker> Upon his <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color> finger he doth wear
    A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
    Which, like a taper in some monument,
    Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
    And shows the ragged entrails of this pit;
    So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
    When he by night lay bath'd in maiden <color is="red" context="death">blood.</color>
    O brother, help me with thy fainting hand-
    If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath-
    Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
    As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
  <speaker>QUINTUS.</speaker> Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,
    Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
    I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
    Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
    I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
  <speaker>MARTIUS.</speaker> Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
  <speaker>QUINTUS.</speaker> Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,

    Speak, gentle niece. What stern ungentle hands
    Hath lopp'd, and hew'd, and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,

    O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him to ease my mind!

    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands

    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind,

    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,
    Because they died in <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>'s lofty bed.
                          <stage>[ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges
                     pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt]</stage>
    For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>.
    Let my <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' sweet <color is="red" context="death">blood </color>will make it <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shame</depiction> and blush.
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his show'rs.
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> I'll melt the snow
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' <color is="red" context="death">blood.</color>
<stage>Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn</stage>
    O reverend Tribunes! O gentle aged men!
    Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,
    And let me say, that never wept before,
    My <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> are now prevailing orators.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> O noble father, you lament in vain;
    The Tribunes hear you not, no man is by,
    And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead!
    Grave Tribunes, once more I entreat of you.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> My gracious <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, no tribune hears you speak.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Why, 'tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
    They would not mark me; if they did mark,
    They would not pity me; yet plead I must,
    And bootless unto them.
    Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
    Who though they cannot answer my distress,
    Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes,
    For that they will not intercept my tale.
    When I do <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weep</depiction>, they humbly at my feet
    Receive my <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>, and seem to <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weep</depiction> with me;
    And were they but attired in grave weeds,
    Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.
    A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
    A stone is silent and offendeth not,
    And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
                                                         <stage>[Rises]</stage>
    But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> To rescue my two brothers from their death;
    For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd
    My everlasting doom of banishment.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> O happy man! they have befriended thee.
    Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
    That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
    Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
    But me and mine; how happy art thou then
    From these devourers to be banished!
    But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
<stage>Enter MARCUS with LAVINIA</stage>
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weep</depiction>,
    Or if not so, thy noble heart to break.
    I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Will it consume me? Let me see it then.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> This was thy daughter.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Why, Marcus, so she is.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Ay me! this object kills me.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
    Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
    Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
    What fool hath added water to the sea,
    Or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?
    My grief was at the height before thou cam'st,
    And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.
    Give me a sword, I'll chop off my <power gender="">hands</power>too,
    For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
    And they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life;
    In bootless prayer have they been held up,
    And they have serv'd me to effectless use.
    Now all the service I require of them
    Is that the one will help to cut the other.
    'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
    For <power gender="">hands</power>to do Rome service is but vain.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
    That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence
    Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
    Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
    Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> O, thus I found her straying in the park,
    Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
    That hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> It was my dear, and he that wounded her
    Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead;
    For now I stand as one upon a rock,
    Environ'd with a wilderness of sea,
    Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
    Expecting ever when some envious surge
    Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
    This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
    Here stands my other son, a banish'd man,
    And here my brother, <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weeping</depiction> at my woes.
    But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
    Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
    Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
    It would have madded me; what shall I do
    Now I behold thy lively body so?
    Thou hast no <power gender="">hands</power>to wipe away thy <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>,
    Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee;
    Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
    Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
    Look, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!
    When I did name her brothers, then fresh <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>
    Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey dew
    Upon a gath'red lily almost withered.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Perchance she <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weeps</depiction> because they kill'd her husband;
    Perchance because she knows them innocent.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
    Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
    No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
    Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
    Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,
    Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.
    Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
    And thou and I sit round about some fountain,
    Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
    How they are stain'd, like meadows yet not dry
    With miry slime left on them by a flood?
    And in the fountain shall we gaze so long,
    Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
    And made a brine-pit with our bitter <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>?
    Or shall we cut away our <power gender="">hands</power>like thine?
    Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
    Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
    What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues
    Plot some device of further misery
    To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Sweet father, cease your <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>; for at your grief
    See how my wretched sister sobs and <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weeps</depiction>.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot
    Thy napkin cannot drink a <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tear</depiction> of mine,
    For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:
    His napkin, with his true <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> all bewet,
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
<stage>Enter AARON the Moor</stage>
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Titus Andronicus, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power> the Emperor
    Sends thee this word, that, if thou love thy sons,
    Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
    Or any one of you, chop off your hand
    And send it to the King: he for the same
    Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,
    And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
    Did ever raven sing so like a lark
    That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
    With all my heart I'll send the Emperor my hand.
    Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
    That hath thrown down so many enemies,
    Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn,
    My youth can better spare my <color is="red" context="death">blood </color>than you,
    And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Which of your <power gender="">hands</power>hath not defended Rome
    And rear'd aloft the <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color> battle-axe,
    Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
    O, none of both but are of high desert!
    My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
    To ransom my two nephews from their death;
    Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
    For fear they die before their pardon come.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> My hand shall go.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> By heaven, it shall not go!
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Sirs, strive no more; such with'red herbs as these
    Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
    Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> And for our father's sake and mother's care,
    Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Then I'll go fetch an axe.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> But I will use the axe.

<stage>Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS</stage>
 <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Now stay your strife. What shall be is dispatch'd.
    Good Aaron, give his Majesty my hand;
    Tell him it was a hand that warded him
    From thousand dangers; bid him bury it.
    More hath it merited- that let it have.
    As for my sons, say I account of them
    As jewels purchas'd at an easy price;
    And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
    Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
   <stage> [Aside]</stage> Their heads I mean. O, how this villainy

    Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace:
    Aaron will have his soul<color is="black" context="">black</color>like his face. Exit
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
    And bow this feeble ruin to the earth;
    If any power pities wretched <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>,
    To that I call!<stage> [To LAVINIA]</stage> What, would'st thou kneel with
me?
    Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers,
    Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
    And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
    When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> O brother, speak with possibility,
    And do not break into these deep extremes.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
    Then be my passions bottomless with them.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> But yet let reason govern thy lament.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> If there were reason for these miseries,
    Then into limits could I bind my woes.
    When heaven doth <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weep</depiction>, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow.
    She is the <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weeping</depiction> welkin, I the earth;
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave; for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
<stage>Enter a MESSENGER, with two heads and a hand</stage>
  <speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker> Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
    For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor.
    Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
    And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back-
    Thy grief their sports, thy resolution mock'd,
    That woe is me to think upon thy woes,
    More than remembrance of my father's death. Exit
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,
    And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
    These miseries are more than may be borne.
    To <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weep</depiction> with them that <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weep</depiction> doth ease some deal,
    But sorrow flouted at is double death.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
    And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
    That ever death should let life bear his name,
    Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!

  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
    As frozen water to a starved snake.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> When will this fearful slumber have an end?
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Now farewell, flatt'ry; die, Andronicus.
    Thou dost not slumber: see thy two sons' heads,
    Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here;
    Thy other banish'd son with this dear sight
    Struck pale and <color is="red" context="death">bloodl</color>ess; and thy brother, I,
    Even like a stony image, cold and numb.
    Ah! now no more will I control thy griefs.
    Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand
    Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight
    The closing up of our most wretched eyes.
    Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Ha, ha, ha!
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Why, I have not another <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tear</depiction> to shed;
    Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
    And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
    And make them blind with tributary <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>.
    Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
    For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
    And threat me I shall never come to bliss
    Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
    Even in their throats that have committed them.
    Come, let me see what task I have to do.
    You heavy people, circle me about,
    That I may turn me to each one of you
    And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
    And in this hand the other will I bear.
    And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
    As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
    Hie to the Goths and raise an army there;
    And if ye love me, as I think you do,
    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
                                           <stage>Exeunt all but Lucius</stage>
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,

    Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
    He leaves his pledges dearer than his life.
    Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
    O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
    But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
    But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
    If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs
    And make proud Saturnine and his empress
    Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his <power type="matriarch">queen</power>.

    Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot;
    Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,
    And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
    With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
    Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
    And, when my heart, all mad with misery,
    Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
    Then thus I thump it down.
   <stage> [To LAVINIA]</stage> Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
    When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
    Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
    Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;

    And just against thy heart make thou a hole,

  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
    Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
    What violent <power gender="">hands</power>can she lay on her life?
    Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands?
    To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er
    How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
    O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
    Lest we remember still that we have none.
    Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
    As if we should forget we had no hands,
    If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
    Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
    Here is no drink. Hark, Marcus, what she says-
    I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
    She says she drinks no other drink but <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>,
    Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks.
    Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
    In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
    As begging hermits in their holy prayers.
    Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
    Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
    But I of these will wrest an alphabet,
    And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.

  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Out on thee, murderer, thou kill'st my heart!
    Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny;

  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Pardon me, sir; it was a<color is="black" context="">black</color>ill-favour'd fly,

    <title>ACT IV. SCENE I. Rome. TITUS' garden</title>

<stage>Enter YOUNG LUCIUS and LAVINIA running after him, and the boy flies from her with his books under his arm.</stage>
<stage>Enter TITUS and MARCUS</stage>
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker> Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
    Follows me everywhere, I know not why.
    Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes!
    Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker> Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Fear her not, Lucius; somewhat doth she mean.
    See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee.
    Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
    Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
    Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
    Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker> My <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
    Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;
    For I have heard my grandsire say full oft
    Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
    And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
    Ran mad for sorrow. That made me to fear;
    Although, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, I know my noble aunt
    Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
    And would not, but in fury, fright my youth;
    Which made me down to throw my books, and fly-
    Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt;
    And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
    I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Lucius, I will. 
                     <stage>[LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which Lucius has let fall]</stage>
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
    Some book there is that she desires to see.
    Which is it, girl, of these?- Open them, boy.-
    But thou art deeper read and better skill'd;
    Come and take choice of all my library,
    And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
    Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
    Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> I think she means that there were more than one
    Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was,
    Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker> Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
    My mother gave it me.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> For love of her that's gone,
    Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
    What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
    This is the tragic tale of Philomel
    And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape;
    And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl,
    Ravish'd and wrong'd as Philomela was,
    Forc'd in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?
    See, see!
    Ay, such a place there is where we did hunt-
    O, had we never, never hunted there!-
    Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
    By nature made for murders and for rapes.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> O, why should nature build so foul a den,
    Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
    What Roman <power type="patriarch">lord</power> it was durst do the deed.
    Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
    That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me.
    Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
    Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
    My <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, look here! Look here, Lavinia!
                                    <stage>[He writes his name with his
                       staff, and guides it with feet and mouth]</stage>
    This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst,
    This after me. I have writ my name
    Without the help of any hand at all.
    Curs'd be that heart that forc'd us to this shift!
    Write thou, good niece, and here display at last
    What God will have discovered for revenge.
    Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
    That we may know the <depiction role="villain" gender="">traitors</depiction> and the truth!
                               <stage>[She takes the staff in her mouth
                          and guides it with stumps, and writes]</stage>
    O, do ye read, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, what she hath writ?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> 'Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius.'
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> What, what! the <depiction role="predator" gender="">lustful</depiction> sons of Tamora
    Performers of this heinous <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color> deed?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Magni Dominator poli,
    Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> O, calm thee, gentle <power type="patriarch">lord</power>! although I know
    There is enough written upon this earth
    To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts,
    And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
    My <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
    And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
    And swear with me- as, with the woeful fere
    And father of that chaste dis<depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ed dame,
    <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape-
    That we will prosecute, by good advice,
    Mortal revenge upon these <depiction role="villain" gender="">traitorous</depiction> Goths,
    And see their <color is="red" context="death">blood </color>or die with this reproach.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how;
    But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:
    The dam will wake; and if she wind ye once,
    She's with the lion deeply still in league,
    And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
    And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
    You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let alone;
    And come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
    And with a gad of steel will write these words,
    And lay it by. The angry northern wind
    Will blow these sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad,
    And where's our lesson, then? Boy, what say you?
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker> I say, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, that if I were a man
    Their mother's bedchamber should not be safe
    For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Ay, that's my boy! Thy father hath full oft
    For his ungrateful country done the like.
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker> And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Come, go with me into mine armoury.
    Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal my boy
    Shall carry from me to the Empress' sons
    Presents that I intend to send them both.
    Come, come; thou'lt do my message, wilt thou not?
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker> Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
    Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house.
    Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court;
    Ay, marry, will we, sir! and we'll be waited on.
                         <stage>Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and YOUNG LUCIUS</stage>
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> O heavens, can you hear a good man groan
    And not relent, or not compassion him?
    Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,
    That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
    Than foemen's marks upon his batt'red shield,
    But yet so just that he will not revenge.
    Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus! Exit

    <title>SCENE II. Rome. The palace</title>

<stage>Enter AARON, DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, at one door; and at the other door,
YOUNG LUCIUS and another with a bundle of weapons, and verses writ upon them</stage>
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
    He hath some message to deliver us.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker> My <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, with all the humbleness I may,
    I greet your <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>s from Andronicus-
   <stage> [Aside]</stage> And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news?
  <speaker>BOY.</speaker><stage> [Aside]</stage> That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
    For villains mark'd with rape.- May it please you,
    My grandsire, well advis'd, hath sent by me
    The goodliest weapons of his armoury
    To gratify your <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>able youth,
    The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say;
    And so I do, and with his gifts present
    Your <power type="patriarch">lords</power>hips, that, whenever you have need,
    You may be armed and appointed well.
    And so I leave you both-<stage> [Aside]</stage> like <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color> villains.
                               <stage>Exeunt YOUNG LUCIUS and attendant</stage>
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> What's here? A scroll, and written round about.
    Let's see:
   <stage> [Reads]</stage> 'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,
    Non eget Mauri iaculis, nec arcu.'
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> O, 'tis a verse in Horace, I know it well;
    I read it in the grammar long ago.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
   <stage> [Aside]</stage> Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
    Here's no sound jest! The old man hath found their guilt,
    And sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines
    That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
    But were our witty Empress well afoot,
    She would applaud Andronicus' conceit.
    But let her rest in her unrest awhile-
    And now, young <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, was't not a happy star
    Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
    Captives, to be advanced to this height?
    It did me good before the palace gate
    To brave the Tribune in his brother's hearing.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> But me more good to see so great a <power type="patriarch">lord</power>
    Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Had he not reason, <power type="patriarch">Lord</power> Demetrius?
    Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> I would we had a thousand Roman dames
    At such a bay, by turn to serve our <depiction role="predator" gender="">lust</depiction>.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> A charitable wish and full of love.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> And that would she for twenty thousand more.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Come, let us go and pray to all the gods
    For our beloved mother in her pains.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker><stage> [Aside]</stage> Pray to the devils; the gods have given us
over.
                                                <stage>[Trumpets sound]</stage>
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Soft! who comes here?
<stage>Enter NURSE, with a blackamoor CHILD</stage>
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> Good morrow, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>.
    O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
    Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
    Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
    What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms?
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye:
    Our Empress' <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shame</depiction> and stately Rome's disgrace!
    She is delivered, <power type="patriarch">lord</power>; she is delivered.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> To whom?
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> I mean she is brought a-bed.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> A devil.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Why, then she is the devil's dam;
    A joyful issue.
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> A joyless, dismal, <color is="black" context="sadness">black</color>, and sorrowful issue!
    Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
    Amongst the fair-fac'd breeders of our clime;
    The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
    And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Zounds, ye whore! Is<color is="black" context="">black</color>so base a hue?
    Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom sure.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Villain, what hast thou done?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> That which thou canst not undo.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Thou hast undone our mother.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Villain, I have done thy mother.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.
    Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
    Accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend!
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> It shall not live.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> It shall not die.
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
    Do execution on my flesh and <color is="red" context="death">blood.</color>
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point.
    Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
                     <stage>[Takes the CHILD from the NURSE, and draws]</stage>
    Stay, <depiction name="Chiron + Demetrius" role="villain" gender="male">murderous villains</depiction>, will you kill your brother!
    Now, by the burning tapers of the sky
    That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
    He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
    That touches this my first-born son and heir.
    I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
    With all his threat'ning band of Typhon's brood,
    Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
    Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
    What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
    Ye white-lim'd walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
    <color is="black" context="unpure">Coal-black</color> is better than another hue
    In that it scorns to bear another hue;
    For all the water in the ocean
    Can never turn the swan's<color is="black" context="unpure">black</color>legs to <color is="white" context="pure">white</color>,
    Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
    Tell the Empress from me I am of age
    To keep mine own- excuse it how she can.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
    The vigour and the picture of my youth.
    This before all the world do I prefer;
    This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
    Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> By this our mother is for ever sham'd.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> I blush to think upon this ignomy.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
    Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
    The close enacts and counsels of thy heart!
    Here's a young lad fram'd of another leer.
    Look how the<color is="black" context="">black</color>slave smiles upon the father,
    As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
    He is your brother, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, sensibly fed
    Of that self-<color is="red" context="death">blood </color>that first gave life to you;
    And from your womb where you imprisoned were
    He is enfranchised and come to light.
    Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
    Although my seal be stamped in his face.
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
    And we will all subscribe to thy advice.
    Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Then sit we down and let us all consult.
    My son and I will have the wind of you:
    Keep there; now talk at pleasure of your safety.
                                                      <stage>[They sit]</stage>
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> How many women saw this child of his?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Why, so, brave <power type="patriarch">lords</power>! When we join in league
    I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor,
    The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
    The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
    But say, again, how many saw the child?
  <speaker>NURSE.</speaker> Cornelia the midwife and myself;
    And no one else but the delivered Empress.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> The Empress, the midwife, and yourself.
    Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
    Go to the Empress, tell her this I said.<stage> [He kills her]</stage>
    Weeke weeke!
    So cries a pig prepared to the spit.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> What mean'st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> O <power type="patriarch">Lord</power>, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
    Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours-
    A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, no.
    And now be it known to you my full intent:
    Not far, one Muliteus lives, my countryman-
    His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
    His child is like to her, fair as you are.
    Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
    And tell them both the circumstance of all,
    And how by this their child shall be advanc'd,
    And be received for the Emperor's heir
    And substituted in the place of mine,
    To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
    And let the Emperor dandle him for his own.
    Hark ye, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>. You see I have given her physic,
                                         <stage>[Pointing to the NURSE]</stage>
    And you must needs bestow her funeral;
    The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms.
    This done, see that you take no longer days,
    But send the midwife presently to me.
    The midwife and the nurse well made away,
    Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
    With secrets.
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> For this care of Tamora,
    Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, bearing off the dead NURSE
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
    There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
    And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.
    Come on, you thick-lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
    I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
    And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
    And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
    To be a warrior and command a camp.

    <title>SCENE III. Rome. A public place</title>

<stage>Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters on the ends of them; with him MARCUS, YOUNG LUCIUS, and other gentlemen, PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, and CAIUS, with bows</stage>
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.
    Sir boy, let me see your archery;
    Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
    Terras Astrea reliquit,
    Be you rememb'red, Marcus; she's gone, she's fled.
    Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
    Go sound the ocean and cast your nets;
    Happily you may catch her in the sea;
    Yet there's as little justice as at land.
    No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;
    'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
    And pierce the inmost centre of the earth;
    Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
    I pray you deliver him this petition.
    Tell him it is for justice and for aid,
    And that it comes from old Andronicus,
    Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
    Ah, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable
    What time I threw the people's suffrages
    On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
    Go get you gone; and pray be careful all,
    And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd.
    This wicked Emperor may have shipp'd her hence;
    And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
    To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
  <speaker>PUBLIUS.</speaker> Therefore, my <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, it highly us concerns
    By day and night t' attend him carefully,
    And feed his humour kindly as we may
    Till time beget some careful remedy.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
    Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war
    Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,
    And vengeance on the <depiction role="villain" gender="">traitor</depiction> Saturnine.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Publius, how now? How now, my masters?
    What, have you met with her?
  <speaker>PUBLIUS.</speaker> No, my good <power type="patriarch">lord</power>; but Pluto sends you word,
    If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall.
    Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,
    He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
    So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
    I'll dive into the burning lake below
    And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
    Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we,
    No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size;
    But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
    Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear;
    And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
    We will solicit heaven, and move the gods
    To send down justice for to wreak our wrongs.
    Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus.
                                      <stage>[He gives them the arrows]</stage>
    'Ad Jovem' that's for you; here 'Ad Apollinem.'
    'Ad Martem' that's for myself.
    Here, boy, 'To Pallas'; here 'To Mercury.'
    'To Saturn,' Caius- not to Saturnine:
    You were as good to shoot against the wind.
    To it, boy. Marcus, loose when I bid.
    Of my word, I have written to effect;
    There's not a god left unsolicited.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court;
    We will afflict the Emperor in his pride.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Now, masters, draw.<stage> [They shoot]</stage> O, well said, Lucius!
    Good boy, in Virgo's lap! Give it Pallas.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> My <power type="patriarch">lord</power>, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
    Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Ha! ha!
    Publius, Publius, hast thou done?
    See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> This was the sport, my <power type="patriarch">lord</power>: when Publius shot,
    The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock
    That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
    And who should find them but the Empress' villain?
    She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose
    But give them to his master for a present.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Why, there it goes! God give his <power type="patriarch">lords</power>hip joy!
<stage>Enter the CLOWN, with a basket and two pigeons in it</stage>
    News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.
    Sirrah, what tidings? Have you any letters?
    Shall I have justice? What says Jupiter?
  <speaker>CLOWN.</speaker> Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them
down
    again, for the man must not be hang'd till the next week.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
  <speaker>CLOWN.</speaker> Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him in
all
    my life.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
  <speaker>CLOWN.</speaker> Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
  <speaker>CLOWN.</speaker> From heaven! Alas, sir, I never came there. God forbid I
    should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I
am
    going with my pigeons to the Tribunal Plebs, to take up a
matter
    of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal's men.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your
    oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to the Emperor from
you.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with
a
    grace?
  <speaker>CLOWN.</speaker> Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Sirrah, come hither. Make no more ado,
    But give your pigeons to the Emperor;
    By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
    Hold, hold! Meanwhile here's money for thy charges.
    Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace deliver up
a
    supplication?
  <speaker>CLOWN.</speaker> Ay, sir.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come
to
    him, at the first approach you must kneel; then kiss his
foot;
    then deliver up your pigeons; and then look for your reward.
I'll
    be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.
  <speaker>CLOWN.</speaker> I warrant you, sir; let me alone.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Sirrah, hast thou a knife? Come let me see it.
    Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
    For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant.
    And when thou hast given it to the Emperor,
    Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
  <speaker>CLOWN.</speaker> God be with you, sir; I will.

  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Why, <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
    An emperor in Rome thus overborne,

    My <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, you know, as know the mightful gods,
    However these disturbers of our peace
    Buzz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd
    But even with law against the wilful sons
    Of old Andronicus. And what an if
    His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
    Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
    His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
    And now he writes to heaven for his redress.
    See, here's 'To Jove' and this 'To Mercury';
    This 'To Apollo'; this 'To the God of War'-
    Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
    What's this but libelling against the Senate,
    And blazoning our unjustice every where?
    A goodly humour, is it not, my <power type="patriarch">lords</power>?
    As who would say in Rome no justice were.
    But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
    Shall be no shelter to these outrages;
    But he and his shall know that justice lives
    In Saturninus' health; whom, if she sleep,

<stage>Enter NUNTIUS AEMILIUS</stage>
    What news with thee, Aemilius?
  <speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker> Arm, my <power type="patriarch">lords</power>! Rome never had more cause.
    The Goths have gathered head; and with a power
    Of high resolved men, bent to the spoil,
    They hither march amain, under conduct
    Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;
    Who threats in course of this revenge to do
    As much as ever Coriolanus did.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
    These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
    As flowers with frost, or grass beat down with storms.
    Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach.
    'Tis he the common people love so much;
    Myself hath often heard them say-
    When I have walked like a private man-
    That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
    And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius,
    And will revolt from me to succour him.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name!
    Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
    The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
    And is not careful what they mean thereby,
    Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
    He can at pleasure stint their melody;
    Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome.
    Then cheer thy spirit; for know thou, Emperor,
    I will enchant the old Andronicus
    With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
    Than baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep,
    When as the one is wounded with the bait,
    The other rotted with delicious feed.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> But he will not entreat his son for us.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> If Tamora entreat him, then he will;
    For I can smooth and fill his aged ears
    With golden promises, that, were his heart
    Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
    Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
   <stage> [To AEMILIUS]</stage> Go thou before to be our ambassador;
    Say that the Emperor requests a parley
    Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting
    Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Aemilius, do this message <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>ably;
    And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
    Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
  <speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker> Your bidding shall I do effectually. Exit
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Now will I to that old Andronicus,

  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Then go successantly, and plead to him.

    <title>ACT V. SCENE I. Plains near Rome</title>
    
<stage>Enter LUCIUS with an army of GOTHS with drums and colours</stage>
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Approved warriors and my faithful friends,
    I have received letters from great Rome
    Which signifies what hate they bear their Emperor
    And how desirous of our sight they are.
    Therefore, great <power type="patriarch">lords</power>, be, as your titles witness,
    Imperious and impatient of your wrongs;
    And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
    Let him make treble satisfaction.
  <speaker>FIRST GOTH.</speaker> Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
    Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,
    Whose high exploits and <depiction role="protector" gender="">honour</depiction>able deeds
    Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
    Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,
    Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day,
    Led by their master to the flow'red fields,
    And be aveng'd on cursed Tamora.
  <speaker>ALL THE GOTHS.</speaker> And as he saith, so say we all with him.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
    But who comes here, led by a <depiction role="predator" gender="">lusty</depiction> Goth?
<stage>Enter a GOTH, leading AARON with his CHILD in his arms</stage>
  <speaker>SECOND GOTH.</speaker> Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
    To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
    And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
    Upon the wasted building, suddenly
    I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
    I made unto the noise, when soon I heard
    The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
    'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
    Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
    Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
    <depiction name="Aaron" role="villain" gender="male">Villain</depiction>, thou mightst have been an emperor;
    But where the bull and cow are both <color is="white" context="pure">milk-white</color>,
    They never do beget a <color is="black" context="dirty">coal-black</color> calf.
    Peace, villain, peace!'- even thus he rates the babe-
    'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,
    Who, when he knows thou art the Empress' babe,
    Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
    With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
    Surpris'd him suddenly, and brought him hither
    To use as you think needful of the man.
    <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> O worthy Goth, this is the <depiction name="Aaron" role="villain" gender="male">incarnate devil</depiction>
    That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
    This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye;
    And here's the base fruit of her burning <depiction role="predator" gender="">lust</depiction>.
    Say, wall-ey'd <depiction name="Aaron" role="villain" gender="male">slave</depiction>, whither wouldst thou convey
    This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
    Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?
    A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
    And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Touch not the boy, he is of royal <color is="red" context="power">blood</color>.
    <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> <depiction name="Aaron" role="villain" gender="male">Too like the sire for ever being good</depiction>.
    First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl-
    A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
    Get me a ladder.
                <stage>[A ladder brought, which AARON is made to climb]</stage>
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Lucius, save the child,
    And bear it from me to the Empress.
    If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things
    That highly may advantage thee to hear;
    If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
    I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Say on; an if it please me which thou speak'st,
    Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,
    'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
    For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,
    Acts of <color is="black" context="danger">black</color> night, abominable deeds,
    Complots of mischief, treason, villainies,
    Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd;
    And this shall all be buried in my death,
    Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god;
    That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> What if I do not? as indeed I do not;
    Yet, for I know thou art religious
    And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
    With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
    Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
    Therefore I urge thy oath. For that I know
    An idiot holds his bauble for a god,
    And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
    To that I'll urge him. Therefore thou shalt vow
    By that same god- what god soe'er it be
    That thou adorest and hast in reverence-
    To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
    Or else I will discover nought to thee.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
    To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
    'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;
    They cut thy sister's tongue, and ravish'd her,
    And cut her hands, and trimm'd her as thou sawest.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> O detestable villain! Call'st thou that trimming?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas
    Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.
    <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> O <depiction name="Aaron" role="villain" gender="male">barbarous beastly villains</depiction> like thyself!
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
    That codding spirit had they from their mother,
    As sure a card as ever won the set;
    That <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color> mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
    As true a dog as ever fought at head.
    Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
    I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
    Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;
    I wrote the letter that thy father found,
    And hid the gold within that letter mention'd,
    Confederate with the <power type="matriarch">Queen</power> and her two sons;
    And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
    Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
    I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
    And, when I had it, drew myself apart
    And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.
    I pried me through the crevice of a wall,
    When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
    Beheld his <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>, and laugh'd so heartily
    That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;
    And when I told the Empress of this sport,
    She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
    And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
  <speaker>GOTH.</speaker> What, canst thou say all this and never blush?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Ay, like a<color is="black" context="">black</color>dog, as the saying is.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
    Even now I curse the day- and yet, I think,
    Few come within the compass of my curse-
    Wherein I did not some notorious ill;
    As kill a man, or else devise his death;
    Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it;
    Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself;
    Set deadly enmity between two friends;
    Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
    Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
    And bid the owners quench them with their <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>.
    Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
    And set them upright at their dear friends' door
    Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,
    And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
    Have with my knife carved in Roman letters
    'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
    Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
    As willingly as one would kill a fly;
    And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
    But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Bring down the devil, for he must not die
    So sweet a death as hanging presently.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> If there be devils, would I were a devil,
    To live and burn in everlasting fire,
    So I might have your company in hell
    But to torment you with my bitter tongue!

  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> I am not mad, I know thee well enough:
    Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;
    Witness these trenches made by grief and care;
    Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
    Witness all sorrow that I know thee well
    For our proud Empress, mighty Tamora.
    Is not thy coming for my other hand?
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Know thou, sad man, I am not Tamora:
    She is thy enemy and I thy friend.
    I am Revenge, sent from th' infernal kingdom
    To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
    By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
    Come down and welcome me to this world's light;
    Confer with me of murder and of death;
    There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
    No vast obscurity or misty vale,
    Where <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color> murder or detested rape
    Can couch for fear but I will find them out;
    And in their ears tell them my dreadful name-
    Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me
    To be a torment to mine enemies?
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> I am; therefore come down and welcome me.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Do me some service ere I come to thee.
    Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
    Now give some surance that thou art Revenge-
    Stab them, or <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tear</depiction> them on thy chariot wheels;
    And then I'll come and be thy waggoner
    And whirl along with thee about the globes.
    Provide thee two proper palfreys,<color is="black" context="">black</color>as jet,
    To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
    And find out murderers in their guilty caves;
    And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
    I will dismount, and by thy waggon wheel
    Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,
    Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
    Until his very downfall in the sea.
    And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
    So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> These are my ministers, and come with me.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Are they thy ministers? What are they call'd?
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Rape and Murder; therefore called so
    'Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Good <power type="patriarch">Lord</power>, how like the Empress' sons they are!
    And you the Empress! But we worldly men
    Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
    O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;
    And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
    I will embrace thee in it by and by.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> This closing with him fits his lunacy.
    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick humours,
    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son,
    And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practice out of hand
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
<stage>Enter TITUS, below</stage>
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.
    Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house.
    Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
    How like the Empress and her sons you are!
    Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor.
    Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
    For well I wot the Empress never wags
    But in her company there is a Moor;
    And, would you represent our <power type="matriarch">queen</power> aright,
    It were convenient you had such a devil.
    But welcome as you are. What shall we do?
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
  <speaker name="Demetrius" gender="man">DEMETRIUS.</speaker> Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
  <speaker name="Chiron" gender="man">CHIRON.</speaker> Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
    And I am sent to be reveng'd on him.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
    And I will be revenged on them all.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
    And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,
    Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
    Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap
    To find another that is like to thee,
    Good Rapine, stab him; he is a ravisher.
    Go thou with them; and in the Emperor's court
    There is a <power type="matriarch">queen</power>, attended by a Moor;
    Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,
    For up and down she doth resemble thee.
    I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
    They have been violent to me and mine.
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
    But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
    To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
    Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
    And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
    When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
    I will bring in the Empress and her sons,
    The Emperor himself, and all thy foes;
    And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
    And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
    What says Andronicus to this device?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Marcus, my brother! 'Tis sad Titus calls.
<stage>Enter MARCUS</stage>
    Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
    Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths.
    Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
    Some of the chiefest <power type="patriarch">princes</power> of the Goths;
    Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are.
    Tell him the Emperor and the Empress too
    Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
    This do thou for my love; and so let him,
    As he regards his aged father's life.

    And take my ministers along with me.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
    Or else I'll call my brother back again,
    And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.

  <speaker>PUBLIUS.</speaker> What is your will?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Know you these two?
  <speaker>PUBLIUS.</speaker> The Empress' sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceiv'd.
    The one is Murder, and Rape is the other's name;
    And therefore bind them, gentle Publius-
    Caius and Valentine, lay <power gender="">hands</power>on them.
    Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
    And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,

    Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;
    But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
    O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
    Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud;
    This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
    You kill'd her husband; and for that vile fault
    Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
    My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
    Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
    Than <power gender="">hands</power>or tongue, her spotless chastity,
    Inhuman <depiction role="villain" gender="">traitors</depiction>, you constrain'd and forc'd.
    What would you say, if I should let you speak?
    Villains, for <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shame</depiction> you could not beg for grace.
    Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
    This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
    Whiles that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
    The basin that receives your guilty <color is="red" context="death">blood.</color>
    You know your mother means to feast with me,
    And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.
    Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust,
    And with your <color is="red" context="death">blood </color>and it I'll make a paste;
    And of the paste a coffin I will rear,
    And make two pasties of your <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shameful</depiction> heads;
    And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,
    Like to the earth, swallow her own increase.
    This is the feast that I have bid her to,
    And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
    For worse than Philomel you us'd my daughter,
    And worse than Progne I will be reveng'd.
    And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
    Receive the <color is="red" context="death">blood;</color> and when that they are dead,
    Let me go grind their bones to powder small,
    And with this hateful liquor temper it;
    And in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd.
    Come, come, be every one officious
    To make this banquet, which I wish may prove
    More stern and <color is="red" context="savage">bloody</color> than the Centaurs' feast.
                                         <stage>[He cuts their throats]</stage>
    So.
    Now bring them in, for I will play the cook,
    And see them ready against their mother comes.

  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Why art thou thus attir'd, Andronicus?

  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> An if your Highness knew my heart, you were.
    My <power type="patriarch">lord</power> the Emperor, resolve me this:
    Was it well done of rash Virginius
    To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
    Because she was enforc'd, stain'd, and deflower'd?
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> It was, Andronicus.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Your reason, mighty <power type="patriarch">lord</power>.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Because the girl should not survive her <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shame</depiction>,
    And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
    A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant
    For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
    Die, die, Lavinia, and thy <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shame</depiction> with thee;<stage> [He kills her]</stage>
    And with thy <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shame</depiction> thy father's sorrow die!
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Kill'd her for whom my <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> have made me blind.
    I am as woeful as Virginius was,
    And have a thousand times more cause than he
    To do this outrage; and it now is done.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Will't please you eat? Will't please your Highness
feed?
  <speaker name="Tamora" gender="woman">TAMORA.</speaker> Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius.
    They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;
    And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
  <speaker name="Saturninus" gender="man">SATURNINUS.</speaker> Go, fetch them hither to us presently.
  <speaker name="Titus Andronicus" gender="man">TITUS.</speaker> Why, there they are, both baked in this pie,
    Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
    Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
    'Tis true, 'tis true: witness my knife's sharp point.

    By uproars sever'd, as a flight of fowl
    Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts?
    O, let me teach you how to knit again
    This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,
    These broken limbs again into one body;
    Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
    And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
    Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
    Do <depiction role="inpure" gender="">shameful</depiction> execution on herself.
    But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
    Grave witnesses of true experience,
    Cannot induce you to attend my words,
   <stage> [To Lucius]</stage> Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
    When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
    To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
    The story of that baleful burning night,
    When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy.
    Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
    Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
    That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
    My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
    Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
    But floods of <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> will drown my oratory
    And break my utt'rance, even in the time
    When it should move ye to attend me most,
    And force you to commiseration.
    Here's Rome's young Captain, let him tell the tale;
    While I stand by and <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weep</depiction> to hear him speak.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you
    That Chiron and the damn'd Demetrius
    Were they that murd'red our Emperor's brother;
    And they it were that ravished our sister.
    For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
    Our father's <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> despis'd, and basely cozen'd
    Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
    And sent her enemies unto the grave.
    Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
    The gates shut on me, and turn'd <depiction role="weakness" gender="">weeping</depiction> out,
    To beg relief among Rome's enemies;
    Who drown'd their enmity in my true <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction>,
    And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend.
    I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
    That have preserv'd her welfare in my <color is="red" context="death">blood
</color>    And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
    Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body.
    Alas! you know I am no vaunter, I;
    My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
    That my report is just and full of truth.
    But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
    Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me!
    For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child.
                  <stage>[Pointing to the CHILD in an attendant's arms]</stage>
    Of this was Tamora delivered,
    The issue of an irreligious Moor,
    Chief architect and plotter of these woes.
    The villain is alive in Titus' house,
    Damn'd as he is, to witness this is true.
    Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
    These wrongs unspeakable, past patience,
    Or more than any living man could bear.
    Now have you heard the truth: what say you, Romans?
    Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,
    And, from the place where you behold us pleading,
    The poor remainder of Andronici
    Will, hand in hand, all headlong hurl ourselves,
    And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,
    And make a mutual closure of our house.
    Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
    Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
  <speaker>AEMILIUS.</speaker> Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
    And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand,
    Lucius our Emperor; for well I know
    The common voice do cry it shall be so.
  <speaker>ALL.</speaker> Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal Emperor!
  <speaker name="Marcus Andronicus" gender="man">MARCUS.</speaker> Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,

    To shed obsequious <depiction role="weakness" gender="">tears</depiction> upon this trunk.

    O, were the sum of these that I should pay
    Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Come hither, boy; come, come, come, and learn of us
    To melt in showers. Thy grandsire lov'd thee well;
    Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee,

  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
    There let him stand and rave and cry for food.
    If any one relieves or pities him,
    For the offence he dies. This is our doom.
    Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth.
  <speaker name="Aaron" gender="man">AARON.</speaker> Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?
    I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
    I should repent the evils I have done;
    Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
    Would I perform, if I might have my will.
    If one good deed in all my life I did,
    I do repent it from my very soul.
  <speaker name="Lucius" gender="man">LUCIUS.</speaker> Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
    And give him burial in his father's grave.
    My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
    Be closed in our household's monument.
    As for that ravenous tiger, Tamora,
    No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed,
    No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
    But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey.
    Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,
    And being dead, let birds on her take pity. Exeunt
THE END
